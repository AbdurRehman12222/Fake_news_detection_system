'A reality show': World reacts to Trump-Biden debate,"Even before last night's debate, the main evening news shows on Russian TV on Thursday were speculating that Mr Biden would not be able to survive it. ""An hour and a half live on air is a test of mental and physical fitness,"" Channel One said, asserting that Mr Biden would ""find it difficult to withstand this"". Both state-owned Channel One and Rossiya 1 reported opinion polling showing that some 60% expected Mr Biden to be given a stimulant to get through the debate. Afterwards, pro-Kremlin commentators portrayed Mr Biden's performance in the debate as lacklustre. Military blog Rybar branded his performance a ""total failure""; while the Telegram channel of the Russia in Global Affairs magazine said that Mr Biden had failed to prove that he was in ""proper physical shape"" to lead the country and that his performance ""appears to have frightened his supporters"". Rossiya 1 TV said on Friday morning that voters were concerned about Mr Biden's ""mental health"". It also highlighted Trump's attacks on Mr Biden's handling of the Ukraine war. Chinese media were enthused by the theatrics of last nights debate, and many outlets highlighted that Mr Biden and Trump didnt shake hands at the beginning of the debate and went on to launch fierce personal attacks against each other. The state-owned Global Times describes the debate as like a reality show. Chinese satirical cartoons often depict a fierce, quite literal, battle between the two candidates, but Chinese audiences enjoyed the more quirky aspects of the debate, such as the pair going off topic to discuss their golf skills. Generally, Chinese media want to paint a picture for audiences of general apathy and frustration among US voters at both candidates. Global Times says they were both scrutinised over their age and stamina; noting that on the campaign trail, Trump was frequently mangling his sentences and that Mr Biden often makes verbal slip-ups. Some outlets take aim at Trump over lying and Mr Biden mumbling. China frequently highlights growing divisions in US society and often suggests the US may descend into civil war. The overall message is that both Trump and Mr Biden are currently facing difficulties. After last nights debate, many took to social media to express concerns about Americas future, Xinhua news agency says. Prominent Indian media outlets highlighted a ""shaky"" performance by Mr Biden and ""aggression"" by Trump in their coverage of the debate. Analysing the ""key takeaways"", a report on Hindustan Times newspaper's website described the debate as a ""high stake face-off that will turn the tide for rest of the campaign"". It said that Mr Biden appeared to be ""struggling and even froze several times"". Trump showed ""more aggression"" and ""capitalised on Bidens missteps"" such as during a discussion on immigration, it added. Some media outlets picked up on Trump's claim Mr Biden was getting ""paid by China"". ""'Manchurian Candidate, Paid By China': Trump's Big Charge Against Biden,"" read a headline on the NDTV channel's website. A report on Firstpost website noted that climate change was a topic where India and China figured in the debate. The US election result is not expected to change India-US ties much as Prime Minister Narendra Modi - who's just started a third term in power - shares a good rapport with both Mr Biden and Trump. In Israel, media agreed that Mr Biden looked weak, and theorised how a Trump presidential win would affect the ongoing Gaza war. During the debate, Trump said if he was president, the 7 October Hamas-led attack on Israel would not have happened. Media highlighted Trumps pro-Israel credentials as he accused Mr Biden of weakness: Hes become like a Palestinian. But they dont like him. Because hes a very bad Palestinian. Hes a very weak one, Trump said. Barak Ravid, the diplomatic correspondent for the Walla news site, said that Mr Biden was ""unfocused on the conflict. ""He failed to explain the extent of his support for Israel and it was possible for Trump to attack him, and present him as someone who is trying to prevent Israel from eliminating Hamas,"" Ravid said. Ynets veteran defence analyst, Ron Ben-Yishai, said: ""Trump is now seen as a candidate whose victory in the presidential elections is almost certain, and all the actors and elements, from Russia and Ukraine to Israel and Saudi Arabia, and also Iran, will conduct themselves from now on according to this assumption."" Ben-Yishai said certain elements in Israel are already rubbing their hands with joy at the prospect of a second Trump presidency. Latin America's media were riveted by what they called the ""tense"" presidential debate, highlighting their rancorous exchanges over immigration, the economy, abortion and global politics. Many media pundits in the region saw Trump succeeding in stoking doubts about Mr Biden's age by pummelling him energetically on issues sensitive to US voters, such as inflation and immigration. ""Trump corners Biden in tense debate,"" was how leading Brazilian daily Folha de Sao Paulo headlined its initial report. Mr Bidens hesitant and confused performance could radically change the scenario of the elections"", Folha added. Posting on X, prominent Mexican journalist Leon Krauze drew a similar conclusion, saying Mr Biden ""stumbled, lost his thread and was incapable of showing up the lies of his rival"". Meanwhile, Argentinas La Nacion said that ""the Democrat president was not able to dispel the doubts about his age and his health, and he set off alarms in his party"". Colombian daily El Tiempo saw the exchanges between Trump and Mr Biden characterised by ""insults, jibes and few proposals"" in which ""neither of the two appeared to overcome the concerns over their advanced age"". The debate shows Trump strong and Biden weak,"" was how Brazilian daily O Estado de S. Paulo summed up one analysis. ""Biden self-destructed in front of the American public and the world... Biden debated desperately badly,"" Brazilian analyst Demetrio Magnoli said on the popular G1 news website. In Mexico, media tend to be wary of calls from US politicians for drastic measures to stem the flow of migrants and illicit drugs, so reporting on the debate homed in on the repeated clashes over immigration, mostly consisting of Trump slamming what he called Mr Biden's failure to secure the border. Left-wing Mexican daily La Jornada highlighted the debate ""clash over migration and the economy"". ""During the first presidential debate, ex-President Donald Trump criticised the immigration policy of the Joe Biden Government and said that migrants would have to be removed from the country for alleged crimes committed against Americans,"" Mexican daily Reforma told its readers. In its coverage, Mexican news magazine Proceso focused on Trump asserting that the US had become a ""nest of rats"" because he said Mr Biden's immigration policies had ""opened the door to criminals, murderers and rapists"". Turkish media outlets and social media users criticised Mr Bidens poor debate performance, which many said led to panic among the Democrats. ""Biden had difficulty understanding the questions and hesitated when answering,"" Hurriyet newspaper said, describing the debate as a ""disaster"" for Biden. Academic Hilmi Bolatoglu said in a post on X that Mr Bidens performance strengthened indications that a new Trump era is approaching. Coverage also raised eyebrows about the general quality of the debate. ""There were many gaffes in the 90-minute debate. Insults and mockery flew in the air, Biden had several hiccups and Trump gave a lot of misinformation,"" Milliyet newspaper said in a report. Looking at the list of lies and distortions that both leaders told, one wonders which of them American voters will elect to wreak havoc on the world, veteran journalist Murat Yetkin said on his YouTube channel. Many pundits in Turkey have long been cool on Mr Bidens presidency, accusing him of hypocrisy on the Israel-Gaza war and voicing doubt about his emphasis on defending the liberal international order."
'Being burglary victim was life-changing',"""I sat there for about half an hour and just had my head in my hands, just contemplating where I was going to go next,"" Steve said. ""The devastation they'd caused, the windows smashed... some of my clothes just in puddles outside. [It was] a tough day."" He added: ""I struggled for three or four weeks after that, not wanting to open the doors. And the paranoia then of every morning waking up and wondering if it's happened again. ""When it's multi-million pound stores and they're pinching t-shirts, it might not affect the people at the top. But when it's a tiny little business like this that I'm hardly taking any wages from, and I'm working six days a week, grafting to try and build it up, it's life-changing. ""They just don't understand what I went through."" If it had not been ""for the love"" he received from social media and the local community, Steve said he believes he would have folded. An American couple inspired to travel to the north Wales city by the documentary Welcome to Wrexham started an online fundraising campaign. Money flooded in  including a large donation from Wrexham FC owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney  and he quickly recovered all his losses. Steve said the police were ""great"" and responded quickly. Despite two people being arrested and released under investigation, nobody has been prosecuted. He thinks burglary and opportunist thefts like shoplifting are increasing in the area, and says he believes there is ""100%"" a link between crime and the cost of living crisis. ""It's tough times, isn't it? People are doing things at the moment that they probably wouldn't normally do in society, and taking chances, potentially sometimes just to feed or clothe their family."" He believes passionately that ""we need to be looking after people better,"" and offering support to criminals to stop them re-offending. ""You see a lot more of it now because there's a prison in the town, so you see a lot of them getting dropped off and they just don't seem to have anywhere to go, anything to do. They need help. ""They need places to be, they need people to advise them. They need people to give them a kick-start, and [then] we might be in a better place."" Dave Rogers runs Traceys Cafe with his wife Tracey in the city centre. Last month, the cafe was broken into and about £1,100 was taken from the tills, as well as charity boxes and staff tip boxes. ""It knocks you sick, knowing that someone's been in and pinched not only the charity, but our money, our hard-earned money,"" Dave said. ""[I've had] many sleepless night over it, and even now you leave and you're thinking 'is it going to be safe?' ""I drive round and I often come back to the café to make sure that it's locked and I can't see anybody in."" He said police responded quickly, but no arrests have been made. Dave said he ""never thought for one minute that we would be broken into,"" adding: ""When someone breaks into your home or your business it's just devastating. You're just waiting for the next time."" Tracey's Cafe has since moved to a new premises. While he believes crime is an important issue for people, Dave says it is ""all down to policing and everybody's got cuts, everybody's cutting back"". ""There seems to be slightly less police  that's due to cuts."" Alex Mackenzie, a criminal defence and prison law solicitor with GHP Legal in Wrexham, said she fell in love with Wrexham when she moved there two years ago - but despite finding people ""lovely for the most part"" there was ""a lot of deprivation"". ""A lot of people that I think may feel sidelined or that they've got nothing to aspire to, which then translates into crime ultimately, unfortunately."" While she is unsure more crime is being committed in the area, she does think the value of things being stolen has increased, which results in more people being given short prison sentences. Rehabilitation and support, she believes, could in many cases be more productive. ""I think the biggest thing is short prison sentences. There's been an increase in the desire  and I understand that desire  to punish people,"" she said. ""But actually what that means is that we're getting a lot of people going into prison for short periods. ""They're coming out, having lost benefits, accommodation, and are finding that they're ending up back in prison much quicker  sometimes because they feel they have to go there because they cant cope outside. ""That revolving door, back in and out, is just spinning so much faster I think now."" An alternative measure, the crime survey for England and Wales, suggests a long term decline in offences since the mid-1990s. On the crime rate  recorded crimes per 1,000 people  then that was 85.4 crimes per 1,000 in Wales. This is slightly more than 2019, before Covid. It has been consistently lower than the England and Wales average. When we take a snapshot of crimes within Wrexham, then there have been 588 shoplifting offences inside the five inner city wards alone in the last year. This represents 17% of all reported crimes, although more than a third have been violence and sexual offences. Welsh Labour said a Labour UK government would ""put 13,000 extra neighbourhood police and PCSOs on the beat and give every community a named and contactable officer they can contact"". The Welsh Conservatives said more than 20,000 extra police officers have been recruited and ""we're going to recruit an extra 8,000 officers across England and Wales who will be dedicated to neighbourhood policing"". Plaid Cymru wants policing devolved to Wales, claiming that ""along with powers over the justice system, this would allow for better resources towards crime prevention and bring down re-offending"". The Liberal Democrats said it also wants policing powers devolved to Wales, and that it would be ""pushing for a new statutory guarantee that all burglaries will be investigated, and we will also be ensuring that survivors of violence against women and girls are properly supported by a criminal justice system that works for them"". Reform believes in a zero-tolerance approach to crime, but said it advocates for rehabilitation schemes to help offenders reintegrate into society and reducing the likelihood of re-offending."
'Constant gunshots' - Hull surgeon's Gaza experience,"At least 37,765 people have been killed in Gaza in the Israeli military offensive which followed, according to the territorys Hamas-run health ministry. Warning: This story contains graphic descriptions which may be distressing ""What I saw was just hunger, starvation, famine, suffering,"" said Dr Sultan. ""It was just like an Armageddon. ""Gaza has been made like a living hell for Gazans and essentially they are living like worse than animals. ""It was a very painful experience to see that - how humans can treat other humans like this. ""I would not have expected what would hit me."" Dr Sultan travelled to Gaza with 14 other surgeons from the UK and the United States. The team of medics were working with a US non-profit organisation called FAJR Scientific, under the umbrella of the World Health Organisation, to treat patients and take medical supplies to the conflict zone. Although the UN and aid agencies have warned of looming famine, there is no evidence that it has occurred, a UN-backed report has said on Tuesday. Dr Sultan said he was compelled to visit Gaza after an emotional appeal by a colleague in Scarborough whose father, a Gazan civilian, was ""shot in the head"" and was in desperate need of urgent life-saving treatment but died hours later. Recalling the moment he landed in Gaza, the medic said: ""The realisation that I'm actually in a war zone - it actually hit me when I was there. ""There was a curfew after five o'clock. There was no electricity, there was no water supply through the taps, and after five o'clock you are in pitch black. Drones are 24/7 over your head. ""You are constantly [under] surveillance and being watched, bombs are falling right and left even when you are in the safe zone. The sound of gunshots was just constant."" He described harrowing scenes of people with decapitated limbs, headless bodies and seeing patients with ""maggots in their wounds and flesh-eating bacteria"". Among the traumatic cases that horrified Dr Sultan was that of a 12-year-old boy, who arrived with severe injuries alongside the dead body of his mother. ""He was in absolute agony and was crying. The paramedics had no painkillers to give to keep him comfortable and he didn't realise that both of his legs were completely destroyed and mangled,"" he said. ""To tell him 'your mother has passed away and you're going to need the amputation of both legs and possibly one hand as well' was absolutely devastating."" Dr Sultan said the child's distressing response when he told him he was the only survivor left in his family ""will always live with me"". ""He said to me, 'I wish you would have killed me. Why did you save me?' ""It was very painful and I hugged him, and I sat with him for more than an hour, chatting with him. ""But inside myself I felt very broken, and I didn't know what more I could do to help this poor child."" The 44-year-old said he treated about 50 injured civilians each day who were ""all pretty much life or limb threatened"" while working in the hospital's A&E unit. ""It was an absolute surprise when I entered the hospital,"" he said. ""The hospital was completely changed into a refugee camp, essentially. There were about 30,000 refugees because all their houses had been destroyed. ""There were tents in the hospital corridor on both sides, which was having a huge impact on the hospital protocol, causing a lot of obstruction in providing the clinical services and then on the cleanliness."" He said the European Hospital was one of the last remaining full hospitals with working facilities, including a dedicated paediatric intensive care unit. However, there was a severe shortage of medical supplies, made worse by the large number of patients being treated. Up to 3,000 people were using the hospital each day, exceeding the original 250-bed capacity. More than 500 healthcare workers had been killed in the past nine months, claimed Dr Sultan. He said local medics were constantly fatigued, working ""24/7 in a voluntary capacity"", and many living with no clean water and basic sanitation. ""Patients are emaciated. The doctors have been reduced to bones,"" he said. ""There are so many sewage leaks, and the sanitation system has completely been destroyed. That creates so many insects and attracts all the kind of diseases around that as well. ""It's so bad on so many different levels and unimaginable. How you can live as a human being like that?"" Dr Sultan said there was an urgent need for new hospitals to be built and access to medical supplies, food and clean water, and he wanted to raise awareness of ""the ground facts"" in Gaza. While the psychological effects of his experience will be lasting, he said his time in Gaza had been ""life-changing"" and had made him ""grateful of everything you have in life"". ""There are things which I've seen, and I don't think I will ever be able to unsee them - the bodies of the children which I was carrying every day.

Send your story ideas to eastyorkslincs.news@bbc.co.uk A surgeon who treated patients in Gaza has said he is planning to go back before Christmas after witnessing ""unimaginable"" suffering there. Dr Junaid Sultan, a vascular surgeon in Hull, spent just under three weeks volunteering at the European Hospital in Rafah in April. He said he treated hundreds of civilian patients, mostly women and children, with bullet wounds, burns and other injuries. Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas have been at war since Hamas gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people, mainly civilians, and taking 251 hostages to Gaza. At least 37,765 people have been killed in Gaza in the Israeli military offensive which followed, according to the territorys Hamas-run health ministry.

'Depraved' man jailed for Grimsby mortuary sex act,"He added: ""You violated and defiled loved ones causing immeasurable harm. ""You caused incredible pain and turmoil and the families may never fully recover. ""It only came to an end because you were disturbed by security staff. Had you not been disturbed, inevitably, there would have been more victims. ""There is a very, very dark side to you."" Tingay pleaded guilty to the sexual penetration of a corpse and trespassing with intent to commit a sexual offence at an earlier hearing. Grimsby Crown Court was told he also has previous criminal convictions including possession of a samurai sword and poses a ""high risk of serious harm to the public"". Prior to sentencing, CCTV footage showed Tingay as he tried to gain access to several areas of the site over a two-hour period. At one point, he was approached by security guards and told to leave but continued to cycle around before making his way to the mortuary. After forcing a door, Tingay entered the building, proceeded to open a number of fridges and disturbed 10 bodies before he carried out sex acts on a further two. He was in the mortuary for four minutes before he was disturbed by security guards and fled the scene. Statements from staff working at the hospital described the incident as ""horrifying"", with one saying it was the ""worst thing I have ever seen in my life"". Prosecutor Jeremy Evans also read out statements from the families of the victims who said they could not understand ""how or why this could happen"" and ""incredible pain"" when they were told what had happened. One person said: ""I keep having nightmares and I can't believe it. This has traumatised me."" During the hearing, defence solicitor Craig Lowe said he had been instructed by Tingay to offer a ""heartfelt apology"" to the family and friends of those impacted by his ""appalling behaviour"". The Northern Lincolnshire and Goole NHS Trust has told the BBC that it has reviewed security across all of its mortuary sites since the incident. A spokesperson added: ""Our principal concern, of course, is the wellbeing of the families of those who have been affected by the dreadful actions of this individual.""

'Fishing has always been my escape from addiction',"Mr English was introduced to the sport as a child and has always fished. ""Having numerous mental health breakdowns over the years and, through addiction, fishing has always been my escape,"" he said. ""Addiction took all that away.""

Nikki has been in a relationship with Mr English for 13 years and said she had supported him through his journey. She said the group was a ""safe, confidential space"" for everyone who has been impacted by addiction, including families and friends. ""We realised there were gaps in a lot of services.

"'High risk' of famine in Gaza persists, new UN-backed report says","The IPC - a global initiative by UN agencies, aid groups and governments - is the primary mechanism the international community uses to conclude whether a famine is happening. Households are classified as IPC Phase 5 (Catastrophe) if they experience an extreme lack of food, starvation and exhaustion of coping strategies. For a famine to be officially declared in a specific area, there must be evidence that at least 20% of households are in Phase 5, 30% of children are suffering from acute malnutrition, and there are two deaths for every 10,000 inhabitants, or four child deaths out of 10,000 children per day, due to outright starvation or to the interaction of malnutrition and disease. In March, the IPC classified 677,000 Gazans - or 30% of the 2.2 million population - as being in Phase 5, including 165,000 people trapped in northern Gaza. It also projected that a famine was imminent in the north by the end of May because of conflict and the near-complete lack of humanitarian access. Israel rejected that analysis, questioning the IPCs transparency, methodology and sources of information. The IPC assessment published on Tuesday says more than 495,000 Gazans, including 60,000 in the north, are still facing catastrophic hunger. In contrast with the assumptions made for the projection period (March  July 2024), the amount of food and non-food commodities allowed into the northern governorates increased, it says. Additionally, the response in the nutrition, water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and health sectors was scaled up. In this context, the available evidence does not indicate that famine is currently occurring. Although an estimated 20% of households in the north are in Phase 5, the thresholds of acute malnutrition and mortality have not been passed, it explains. The World Health Organization said earlier this month that 32 deaths attributed to malnutrition, including 28 among children under five years old, had been reported by local health officials. The IPC report warns that there continues to be a high and sustained risk of famine across the whole Gaza Strip, and that the improvement in April and May should not allow room for complacency. The WFP said the slight improvement seen in the IPC report showed the difference that greater access could make, but stressed that the situation was still desperate. To truly turn the corner and prevent famine, adequate and sustained levels of humanitarian assistance must be provided, it added. Meanwhile, the head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) told reporters in Geneva that at least 10 children a day on average were losing one or both of their legs because of the war. Philippe Lazzarini said that figure did not include children who had lost hands or arms, and that the amputations usually took place in what he described as quite horrible conditions and sometimes without anaesthetic. In Gaza, at least 24 people - including the sister of Hamass Qatar-based political chief Ismail Haniyeh - were reportedly killed in three Israeli air strikes in northern Gaza early on Tuesday. Health officials told Reuters news agency that 14 people were killed in strikes on two schools used as shelters by displaced people in the central Daraj area of Gaza City and the urban Shati refugee camp, to the north. The Israeli military said in a statement that aircraft had struck two structures that were being used by Hamas terrorists in Shati and Daraj. The terrorists operated inside school compounds that were used by Hamas as a shield for its terrorist activities, it added, accusing some of them of being involved in holding hostages and taking part in the 7 October attack. Hamas has previously denied using schools for military purposes. The other 10 people were said to have been killed in a pre-dawn strike on a house in Shati. A neighbour and Palestinian media identified those killed as Ismail Haniyeh's sister Zahr and nine members of her family. Mr Haniyeh - who also lost three of his sons and several grandchildren in a strike in April - said the killing of his relatives would not make Hamas change its stance and reaffirmed the groups demands for a ceasefire and hostage release deal. Th Israeli military has so far not commented on the reports. Médecins Sans Frontières meanwhile expressed outrage at the horrific and cynical killing of one of its staff members in an attack in Gaza City on Tuesday morning. Physiotherapist Fadi al-Wadiya was killed along with five other people, including three children, as he cycled to the MSF clinic where he worked, the charity said, without blaming any party. The Israeli military later announced that it had killed Fadi al-Wadiya in an air strike, accusing him of being a significant [Palestinian] Islamic Jihad terrorist who had developed the groups rockets array. A UN-backed assessment says almost half a million Palestinians across Gaza are still facing catastrophic levels of hunger and that a high risk of famine persists as long as the Israel-Hamas war continues and humanitarian access is restricted. However, the report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) says the available evidence does not indicate a famine is currently occurring in the north of the Palestinian territory. The previous assessment in March had projected that one was imminent in the area. The amount of food and other aid allowed into the north has increased since then, and nutrition, water, sanitation and health services have been stepped up, the report says. But it warns that food availability in the south and central Gaza has been significantly reduced due to the closure of the Rafah border crossing and the displacement of more than one million people from the city of Rafah since early May, when Israel launched a ground operation there. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said the report paints a stark picture of ongoing hunger and showed the critical importance of sustained humanitarian access. UN officials have blamed the situation on Israeli military restrictions on aid deliveries, the ongoing hostilities and the breakdown of law and order. Israel insists there are no limits to the amount of aid that can be delivered into and across Gaza and blames UN agencies for failing to distribute supplies. It also accuses Hamas of stealing aid, which the group denies. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 37,650 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

'Horrific' and 'ugly' - World Cup semi-final pitch criticised,nan
'I always wanted to be a criminal',"As a teenager, he began shoplifting and stealing from other teens. He was kicked out of mainstream schooling at the age of 12 and was then sent to a boarding school in Chippenham, Wiltshire, where the pattern of low-level crime continued and led to another expulsion. During his time at the Chippenham school, he met a Connections Support charity worker called Nicky. Her role was to encourage students to make ""positive future career decisions"". Despite leaving her job, Nicky continued to visit him while he was in a young offender institution and never gave up on him. She had no ties to any company - she just did it herself, he said. I cant even say what was different about her. In my life, everyone just gave up. She never acknowledged the good and bad in what I was. ""She just acknowledged me as a person."" Trueman was last imprisoned for four years for robbery. He was released in 2016. By that time, he had become a father. ""I missed two years of her [his daughter's] life. I knew I had to change,"" he said. In 2019, Nicky introduced him to Key4Life - a crime prevention charity that works to rehabilitate young offenders. Key4Life was formed by Eva Hamilton MBE in response to the 2011 riots. The riots started in London and spread to towns and cities across the UK after Mark Duggan was shot dead by police in Tottenham. The charity's seven-step model is based on Ms Hamilton's 37 years' experience of rehabilitating marginalised sectors of society. The Ministry of Justice Data Lab recognised it as ""one of the most effective models for creating change in this area"". Participants are offered programmes designed to build resilience and improve behaviour, through a blend of music, football and equine therapy. It also offers courses, including a mentorship training scheme that Trueman joined. If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article you can find sources of help from BBC Action Line. At first, Trueman said he ""didn't believe"" he could transform his life. But once he started seeing his peers on the course turning their lives around, his mindset changed. All the people Ive been to prison with are all changing and finally getting jobs and their lives are getting better,"" he said. ""When I saw that, I wanted that same opportunity, so I put everything I had into it to change."" Earlier this year, Trueman received a call offering him a part-time role as a mentor at the charity. He now speaks to people who are at risk of imprisonment, and helps young offenders ""do small things"" to keep them on the right path. This includes helping them to apply for a driving licence, signing them up at job centres, and completing admin tasks. Since beginning the role, Trueman's life has ""changed dramatically"", he said. ""Before, I would always think if this fails then Ill go back - whereas this time, its not like that,"" he added. ""I can see that the path Im on now is better than any path Ive ever been on so I dont want to let go of it. Charity founder Eva Hamilton said: For Trueman, and so many of the young men who go through our programme, its amazing to see what can happen when they start taking responsibility for their past and unlock their pain. ""Doors will open and many exciting opportunities become available that would have seemed impossible before they took that first step to make a change. ""And giving back to other young men as a Key Mentor with Key4Life offers a tremendous opportunity for growth, while giving back to others. ""I want to help people as much as I can until they succeed,"" Trueman said. ""In five years, life can change for the greatest. I feel like I shouldve gone down this path a lot sooner than I did, but obviously we cant dwell on the past. We can only think of the future.""

'I feel demonised by politicians for having a disability',"""I'm looking for someone who's just going to care about people with disabilities, not forcing us into jobs we can't do,"" she said. Now studying for a degree in game design and creative writing at Brunel University in West London, Sophie said she had previously been pushed towards jobs like HGV driving, despite being registered visually impaired since 2012. She has glaucoma, in which damage to the optic nerve has affected her peripheral vision, as well as aniridia, a condition where people have no iris resulting in light sensitivity. Sophie says watching the political debates on TV, she has rarely heard the politicians talking about disabilities. With all the manifestoes now published she says too often the emphasis appears to be on cutting the costs to the taxpayer of benefits, including the Personal Independence Payment, which is supposed to help people like her with the additional costs of living with their disabilities. The Liberal Democrats say the presumption would be that every disabled person has the right to work from home. They also want a targeted strategy to support disabled people into work The Greens want pay gap legislation to ensure disabled people are paid fairly. They also want to ensure that all disabled workers have the in-job support they need. Labour policies include tackling the backlog of Access to Work claims, and the party says they believe the Work Capability Assessment is not working and needs to be reformed or replaced. Reform says it will ensure ""those who can work do work"" and that Personal Independence Payment and Work Capability Assessment should be face-to-face. The Conservatives say they will reform disability benefits so they are better targeted and reflect peoples genuine needs, and will stop PIP claims from rising unsustainably. Charity the Business Disability Forum has pointed out the election is taking place shortly before the Paralympics, which will see athletes with disabilities converging on Paris. Politicians should see the games as a role model for how they view disability, according to the organisation's chief executive, Diane Lightfoot.

'I feel terrible for him and America': Voters worry about Biden,"This long-time Democrat found the debate so hard to watch, she could barely keep the broadcast on. But regardless of the candidates' performances, she plans to vote blue in November. I didnt watch the whole thing. I could not handle it, this is the best our country can do? If Hillary would have walked out in her pantsuit I would have been happy as hell. I absolutely despise Trump and everything he stands for - his lying, cheating and lack of morals. Biden is a much better human being, but I felt so bad for him (at the debate) and it was such a disappointment. I was thinking State of the Union ""Jacked up Joe"". No, what we got was everything that everyone saying was wrong with him just showed up on stage. I feel terrible for him and America, but we just have to ride it out. Honestly, the debate really kind of disengaged me. I feel like theres nothing I can do but vote blue, whoever it is. Dominic identifies as a Libertarian and voted third-party in 2016 and 2020, but this time around he's fully backing the former president. I'm a fan of Trump and I'm enthusiastically going to be voting for him. Going into this debate, I thought the Republicans were setting themselves up for failure. I actually am surprised Biden did as poorly as he did, I thought hed do better. I was moderately happy with Trump. I thought he seemed much more presidential, especially compared to the debates last time around. He was really negative last time. I think he struck the perfect tone (at the debate). The Trump you saw on stage was much different than the one you saw in 2016. The 2016 Trump would have taken a lot more cheap shots at Bidens age. Biden seemed very defeated in his body language. I think Trump seemed very presidential with how he dealt with Biden's age. I'm enthusiastically going to vote for Trump at this point and I didnt vote for him in either 2016 and 2020. [Dominic texted a few minutes later] In 2016, you almost could've considered me a Never Trumper. My opinion on him has completely changed. Connor is Democrat who voted for Biden in 2020. He plans to do the same in 2024, but is concerned about the president's age. I am nervous about a second Biden term. Theres no doubt in my mind that the people surrounding Biden are competent and have the ability to carry out the necessities of the executive branch. Theres also no doubt in my mind that Biden has the best interest of this country at heart. That being said, I am less confident in the ability of Biden to lead this country today than I ever have been. The Biden administration's efforts on infrastructure, rallying our allies, pardoning of those with marijuana offences, investing in clean energy and forward looking technologies, and reducing prescription drug prices are all monumental actions. I think this first term has been fairly successful, which is why it pains me to say Biden may not be the best figurehead for these policies or moment. I dont think any of this could convince me to vote for Trump. I simply could not get behind a candidate who has reduced faith in our election system dramatically while all his own advisers told him he was wrong. Or a candidate who is clearly lacking in any moral character based on his extramarital affairs that have now been accepted as fact in a court of law and a myriad of other scandals. Or a candidate that enables the worst sort of hatred and politicisation in every facet of our society and government. Or a candidate who I have never heard speak intelligently or in depth about any topic ever. Crystal is an ardent supporter of Trump who voted for the former president twice before and will again in November. Trump came across very level-headed and presidential and Biden came across very weak. I really did not think it was a good idea for Biden to even do this debate. He actually did not look mentally sound to me. He came across really weak and feeble. It was painful to watch 90 minutes of this debate between Biden and Trump. The fentanyl crisis, border security and of course the economy are my top three concerns, and I did not feel like Biden addressed those issues at all. I'm against abortion and against the abortion pill like Trump. I like that he is pro-life and I like that he sides with Christian conservative values. I think this country respects him and after this debate, I really think hell win. This debate solidified that he can win and will win. Shana plans to back Biden in the upcoming election but is not happy with the country's current state of affairs. I was very frustrated watching the debate. I feel that the answers that they were giving werent really answers to any of the questions. It was exhausting to watch. I dont think either of them performed better than the other. Mr Biden looked tired, he looked weak. Even if he did have a cold and he had good things to say, he wasn't getting it out and he wasnt understandable. That reminds me of how Kennedy beat Nixon in the first televised debate by looking healthier. Trump was being aggressive, going off on tangents. Although he appeared stronger in physicality, I dont think he did well in content. I believe I'm still going to vote for Mr Biden because I dont want Mr Trump in office. I would love it if both parties would reconsider their candidates. I know that idea is being thrown around right now, it would do us better. Before Biden announced running for re-election, I was hoping he would step aside for someone else to come forward. But I would rather a Democrat be in office than Mr Trump. Eric is an Independent voter who voted third-party in 2020, but hasn't yet decided what he'll do come November. Trump is old psychopathic liar who is running solely to keep himself out of jail and will say literally anything he can to protect himself. Biden is old, feeble and out of touch with his constituency. Personally, I think President Biden does a better job at listening to different viewpoints. It was telling to me when the moderators would ask questions, Trump would talk about what topics he wanted to. I'm undecided at this point, I'm going to wait and see what happens. A lot of things could change between now and November. Personally, I don't see a compelling reason to vote for either person up there, but I do see compelling reasons to vote against people up there. I would like to see a candidate that I can get behind a vote for, rather than vote against somebody. I want someone who is more interested in doing the job than getting re-elected again. Neither Trump nor Biden are young. I don't know whether one of them can hold up to four years of being president. The fact that both of them were up there arguing about their golf game tells me they're more interested in other things than running a country. This long-time Democrat found the debate so hard to watch, she could barely keep the broadcast on. But regardless of the candidates' performances, she plans to vote blue in November. I didnt watch the whole thing. I could not handle it, this is the best our country can do? If Hillary would have walked out in her pantsuit I would have been happy as hell. I absolutely despise Trump and everything he stands for - his lying, cheating and lack of morals. Biden is a much better human being, but I felt so bad for him (at the debate) and it was such a disappointment. I was thinking State of the Union ""Jacked up Joe"". No, what we got was everything that everyone saying was wrong with him just showed up on stage. I feel terrible for him and America, but we just have to ride it out. Honestly, the debate really kind of disengaged me. I feel like theres nothing I can do but vote blue, whoever it is. Dominic identifies as a Libertarian and voted third-party in 2016 and 2020, but this time around he's fully backing the former president. I'm a fan of Trump and I'm enthusiastically going to be voting for him. Going into this debate, I thought the Republicans were setting themselves up for failure. I actually am surprised Biden did as poorly as he did, I thought hed do better. I was moderately happy with Trump. I thought he seemed much more presidential, especially compared to the debates last time around. He was really negative last time. I think he struck the perfect tone (at the debate). The Trump you saw on stage was much different than the one you saw in 2016. The 2016 Trump would have taken a lot more cheap shots at Bidens age. Biden seemed very defeated in his body language. I think Trump seemed very presidential with how he dealt with Biden's age. I'm enthusiastically going to vote for Trump at this point and I didnt vote for him in either 2016 and 2020.

President Joe Biden and former president Donald Trump squared off on Thursday night in the first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle. Voters across the country have expressed concerned about the candidates' ages - Mr Biden is 81 and Trump is 78 - and the debate supercharged that anxiety. Still, with weeks left until the conventions when each party will formalise their choice of candidate, supporters of both major parties feel they are left with few options. The BBC spoke to Democratic, Republican and independent voters who told us they are concerned about Mr Biden's fitness for the ticket. After Thursday's debate, we asked them if his widely criticised performance will sway how they vote. We start with a voter who feels that she has no choice but to support the president. This long-time Democrat found the debate so hard to watch, she could barely keep the broadcast on. But regardless of the candidates' performances, she plans to vote blue in November.

"'I weigh kids on beach', says donkey-ride owner","Mr Nuttall, whose company operates on beaches in Skegness and Cleethorpes, has put up weighing stations on the sand. He said: ""It's a sign of the times. Years ago you never had that. Kids were fit and healthy."" As well as weight restrictions, Mr Nuttall said riders must be under 4ft 7ins (1.4m) and aged 10 or under. According to data released in October by the NHS, 20% of 10 and 11-year-olds in the East Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, which includes Skegness, were obese last year. Mr Nuttall claimed allowing obese children to ride posed risks to them and the donkeys. He said: ""If a child, due to their size, cannot keep their balance, there is a danger they could slip off the saddle, injuring themselves and the donkey. We assess all riders for the donkey they wish to ride."" While some children were ""disappointed"" when refused a ride, neither he nor his staff had experienced any abuse from families. ""People are understanding,"" he said. ""Ultimately, it's about the welfare of the donkeys. ""The days of donkeys going up and down a beach with an adult on its back are long gone."" Mr Nuttall blamed fast-food culture and a lack of physical exercise for the issue. ""Children need exercise,"" he said. ""I have three boys and a girl and they are fit as fleas because they don't eat rubbish and they go to the gym and take regular exercise."" The Obesity Health Alliance is a coalition of more than 50 organisations and has a goal of preventing obesity-related ill-health. Ms Jenner also blamed the ""environment that surrounds children"". ""It's the unhealthy food and drink that they have on their plates, in their high streets, in their schools,"" she said. ""That's where we should be focussing our attention to try and improve what children are being given, rather than embarrassing them about their size."" In Skegness, the holidaymakers the BBC spoke to generally seemed in agreement with the restrictions. Grandmother-of-five Dawn Fraser, 54, said: ""Kids are getting bigger. It's shocking."" However, Angela Coles, 60, said: ""It seems a little unfair when people have come all this way on holiday. It spoils it."" Mr Nuttall insisted he was ""not being nasty"". ""We're just saying if you come within the size and weight, you can ride. If not, you don't go on."" Those children deemed too heavy to ride were ""still free to stroke the donkeys"", he added.

'I'm forced to choose love or disability benefit',"Ms Kindred, 26, has been declared unfit for work by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) because of her condition, which causes the body's collagen to mutate on a genetic level, leaving her with joint hypermobility and poor balance and co-ordination. She receives a £405.40 Personal Independence Payment (PIP) per month and  £809.64 in universal credit every four weeks. Ms Kindred said she found it ""nonsensical"" that her parents' income was not considered but if she moved in with her partner, who earns about £30,000 a year, a government benefits calculator suggested she would lose her universal credit payments. ""Id like to move in with my partner of five years but unfortunately we cant because of the living-as-if-married clause from the Department for Work and Pensions. ""Thats £405 a month to live on entirely, that's before I pay for a private physio, which makes up for what the NHS cant provide for me."" Im basically stuck living with my parents because thats the only option available to me."" Ms Kindred also raised concerns about  proposed changes to PIP by the Conservatives that would see changes to the way payments are made. The charity Ehlers-Danlos Support UK said it had concerns about proposed changes to PIP. In a statement, it said: ""EDS is misunderstood and diagnosis can take decades. This makes it hard to evidence the daily struggle of living with this illness. ""We are concerned by the proposed changes to PIP and reached out to our members to better understand their experiences. ""We have encouraged them to respond to the consultation. ""Our Adviceline has also seen a significant rise in members asking for help with benefits which is indicative of the growing problems people with EDS face in the UK."" The Liberal Democrats say they will give disabled people and organisations representing them a stronger voice in the design of benefits policies and processes. They will bring work capability assessments in-house, reform PIP assessments to make the process more transparent and stop unnecessary reassessments, and end the use of informal assessments. The Greens say they will restore the value of disability benefits, with an immediate uplift of 5%. They will reform intrusive eligibility tests like PIP and the unfair targeting of carers and disabled people on benefits. And in the long term, introduce a universal basic income to give everybody the security to start a business, study, train and live their life in dignity. Labour want to work with local areas to create plans to support more disabled people and those with health conditions into work. They will devolve funding so local areas can shape a joined-up work, health, and skills offer for local people. While they pledge to tackle a backlog of Access to Work claims, they do not say anything about benefits such as PIP. Reform UK says says PIP and work capability assessments should be face-to-face. They will require independent medical assessments to prove eligibility for payments. Those registered with severe disabilities or serious long-term illnesses would be exempt from regular checks. The Conservatives say they will reform benefits to stop a projected rise in PIP payouts. But the manifesto does not give details of changes beyond pledging a more objective assessment of an individual's needs. They say they will make the assessment process simpler and fairer for those with the most severe conditions. Poll tracker: How do the parties compare?

'I'm going to have to pay for healthcare until my grave',"John Hayes, who lives in Biddisham, in Somerset, wants to see improvements with the management of the NHS. Mr Hayes, who lives with his wife and is kept busy by his six grandchildren, is retired from a 42-year career in business and finance. He believes ""we wouldn't run companies like the NHS is being run"". ""The NHS swallows up more than £180bn a year but the failure to recruit and train healthcare staff has caused all the problems it has now with poor patient access and long waiting lists,"" he said. ""All the parties say 'we'll put more money in' but that is not the answer. The answer is to sort out the management and what is going on in the NHS."" Mr Hayes had treatment for cataracts in both eyes as an NHS patient at a local private hospital and said it was ""very good"". He would now like to see the government using more private hospitals. His wife also recently paid for their granddaughter to have her adenoids removed privately, after being told she would have to wait up to two years for NHS surgery. ""The NHS should be capable of caring for everybody, from the cradle to the grave,"" he said. ""But the way things are going, I'm going to end up paying for my healthcare until I get to the grave."" Su Eckersley, who lives alone in Bridgwater without family locally, is worried about requiring emergency treatment from the NHS. ""Up until recent years I've been quite confident that if I should need the NHS in an emergency they would be there for me. Now, that is no longer what I feel,"" she said. ""As I get older I'm aware there may be instances where I might need emergency treatment and I am very worried that if I should ask for that emergency treatment it's just not going to be there... and that does worry me greatly."" Ms Eckersley is currently on a waiting list to see a hospital consultant after being referred by her GP. She has been warned it could take half a year before she ""hears anything"". ""You don't know what's going to happen in those six months, and it could be something that could be avoided if there was a speedy response to a request for an appointment,"" she said. The Conservative manifesto promised to increase NHS spending above inflation every year. It said they would continue programmes to build 40 new hospitals by 2030 and recruit 28,000 more doctors and 92,000 more nurses by 2029. It also pledged to expand community care with 250 new and modernised GP surgeries, 50 new Community Diagnostic Centres and by letting pharmacies offer more treatments. Labour's manifesto promised to cut NHS waiting times with 40,000 more appointments a week, by paying staff more to work weekends and evenings. The party would expand the NHS workforce with thousands more medical training places, and modernise hospital equipment and buildings to ""catch cancer and other conditions earlier"". Labour has also said it would guarantee a face-to-face GP appointment by training more GPs, and modernise the appointment booking system to end the 08:00 scramble. The Liberal Democrats said they would give everyone the right to see their GP within seven days - or 24 hours in urgent cases  with 8,000 more GPs. They have also released a 10-year plan to invest in and repair hospitals and improve early access to mental health services, including walk-in hubs for children and young people. The Greens have pledged to increase NHS budgets by £8bn a year - rising to £28bn a year in 2030 - with a further £20bn over five years for hospital buildings. It also wants to raise NHS pay, including a 35% increase for junior doctors, and reduce waiting lists every year. Reform UK said it will cut NHS waiting lists to zero, introduce a basic income tax rate of zero for staff in the sector for three years and end caps on training new staff. It also wants to make greater use of independent providers and introduce a voucher scheme to let patients go private if treatment deadlines are not met. Follow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

'I've got 100 questions' about lying police chief,"Mr Adderley's career in the police service ended when a panel upheld all allegations against him following a five-day gross misconduct hearing. It concluded he had lied on his CV about being trained at the Britannia Royal Naval College and about being a ""commended officer"" in the Royal Navy. The acting chief constable, Ivan Balhatchet, said: ""This has been difficult for everyone, it's been difficult for me as well, ""I've got 100 questions that I'll never ask but I'm the chief constable, my priority is to do the best for this county and for the police force."" Mr Balhatchet added that ""trust in the police is the worst it's ever been, and I totally understand why that is"". It has also been a difficult time for rank and file officers in the constabulary. Sam Dobbs represents the lower ranks within the force as chairman of the local branch of the Police Federation. He said: ""The responses you get from officers range from 'good riddance, he needed to go, he let us all down' all the way through to 'if you're in touch with him, please let him know that he did loads of good for us as well - you can't excuse this, but he's probably one of the best chief constables we've had'."" He added that the conclusion that Mr Adderley was lying was ""awful because he is top of the tree of an organisation that stands for honesty and integrity."" The newly-elected Labour police, fire and crime commissioner, Danielle Stone, said she hoped the acting chief would ""steer the ship"". ""We need a bit of stability and we need to rebuild confidence within the force and Ivan has got a really strong leadership team that can do that for us,"" she said.

"'I've had bananas thrown at me,' says referee","Ive been to a few dodgy places and people dont realise being a black referee is hard but it is enjoyable, he said. There was one game where the team was just about to take a corner and a banana got thrown at me. So, I picked it up, peeled it, and ate it. I thought I was going to get in trouble but then afterwards the person who chucked it shook my hand. When you do certain games, you are the bad person because you are the referee, and you do get threatened - but we do get a bit more respect now. Despite the discrimination he has endured Mr Moore, who is a Level-5 referee, persevered and has now been celebrated for his commitment to the game. During a ceremony held at Wembley Stadium he was commended in the inspirational role model category at the Referee Recognition Awards. He said: I couldnt believe it and just thought, This is not happening. I was in shock and I could have cried when I was walking on to the stage. It was a dream come true and I never thought in my lifetime I would ever make it to Wembley.

Ian Moore, 60, first took to the pitch with a whistle around his neck 24 years ago after a referee failed to turn up for one of his daughters football matches. Since then he has officiated more than 200 games across the county in atmospheres both pleasant and hostile as part of the Suffolk FA.

'India triumph as World Cup gets its Hollywood finale',nan nan
'It's in God's hands now': Georgia voters brace for close election,"Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump by fewer than 12,000 votes to win the crucial state of Georgia in the 2020 election, elevating its status as an influential political battleground. The two men will face off in the first presidential debate in Atlanta on Thursday, putting a spotlight on the pivotal role Georgia will again play in November. On a hot summer Sunday, hundreds gathered in Atlanta's Piedmont Park to celebrate Juneteenth, Americas newest national holiday, which commemorates the end of slavery. There were smiles and laughter. Corn dogs and curly fries. Pride and pain. Jimmy Hill was there, resting beneath the shade of a tree. He sat next to an installation of columns erected in the park, each decorated with synthetic roses and the faces of black Americans shot and killed by police. One of the faces  Jimmy Atchison  was Mr Hills son. Mr Hill voted for Joe Biden in 2020, lured by the Democratic candidates promises for police reform. Ive always voted Democrat, the 62-year-old said. But four years later, his allegiance to the party is beginning to waver. [Biden] hasnt done anything on police reform, Mr Hill said. The conversation has gone out the back door. His uncertainty reflects broader concerns among Georgia's black and Latino population, a reliable Democratic voting bloc now showing signs of a crumbling coalition. The group voted in record numbers in 2020, helping Joe Biden to win the state by less than 1%. The upset victory arrived on the heels of a long-diversifying population and high-profile local Democrats also on the ballot. On Thursday, a mile from the Juneteenth celebration in Piedmont Park, President Biden and his Republican opponent Donald Trump will come under the lights of the primetime television debate stage for the first time in four years. Each man - president and former president - will be trying to convince the nation that they deserve another term in the White House. The road to get there runs through battleground states like Georgia, where voters know they play an outsized role in deciding who becomes president. In November, the razor-thin race is set to be decided here and in a handful of other states across the nation: Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada. Current polling shows Mr Biden has lost significant ground in Georgia. A March survery by the BBCs media partner CBS News found the former president leading President Biden by 3%. Before 2020, a Democratic candidate for president hadnt been elected in Georgia since 1992. But a confluence of unique events helped push Joe Biden over the line, including record voter turnout from the states growing population of young, black and Latino voters. In 2020, a deadly pandemic had engulfed the globe and shut down much of daily life. The election also came amid a nationwide racial reckoning following widespread protests over the police killings of George Floyd and other black Americans  an issue Mr Biden vowed to tackle on the campaign trail. Two months after Mr Bidens win, the state elected two Democrats, including its first black senator, Raphael Warnock, to the US Senate, in runoff elections. The upset victories flipped the states two seats from red to blue and handed control of the upper chamber to Democrats. 2020 was a different beast, said Kendra Cotton, executive director of the New Georgia Project, a non-partisan organisation that leads voter outreach efforts among metro Atlantas communities of colour. When you talk about getting people out, it was like a perfect storm. Many in Georgia attribute record turnout to the states grassroots coalition, a decade-long project led by Democrat and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams. Abrams founded the New Georgia Project and Fair Fight, two of Georgias largest voting rights organisations. But many of the dynamics that motivated black and Latino voters and powered Mr Bidens win have disappeared. And some organisers worry new challenges  from inflation to the Israel-Gaza war  are causing Mr Bidens grip on the consequential voting bloc to slip. People are concerned about the cost of living. The rising housing costs. The lack of affordability, Ms Cotton said. The fallout from the Israel-Gaza war is something thats weighing on the hearts and minds of voters we reach out to, she added.  Voters are not enthusiastic about their choices."" The 2024 landscape has left Republicans and Democrats puzzled about what will happen in November. Elisha Bennett, a Republican, put it this way: Its in Gods hands now. Roughly 77 miles (123km) north of Atlanta, in the rolling hills of East Ellijay, the tone among voters contrasts heavily with those at Piedmont Park. There, amid the pockets of wild daisies and gun stores dotting the road, lies the Trump Store & More. I voted for Trump in 2016, and 2020, and I will vote for him again, Fran Diemer, the stores clerk, said. Hes the best thing to ever happen to this country and we need him back. Standing behind the counter, where Trumps face appears on everything from pins to pocketknives, she reflected on his presidency with a big grin. Gas was cheap. Groceries were cheap. Taxes were cheap. He took care of us, she said. On Sunday, the same day as Atlantas final Juneteenth celebration, people in East Ellijay gathered at the Lions Club Fairgrounds to view the Vietnam Traveling Memorial Wall, about two miles from the Trump store. Gloria Murphy, a nearby resident, came there to pay tribute to her high school friend that was killed in the war. Like, Ms Diemer, she had also consistently voted for Trump and said her enthusiasm to do so again remained high. The economy, the war, its just disheartening to see everybody fighting, she said. Since Biden has been in office, peoples sense of patriotism has dwindled. Im hoping Trump can restore that somehow. Margot, a Trump supporter who was also at the memorial but did not want to share her last name, said: If nothing changes politically, it is going to be, in my opinion, a very different and very scary world. There are 159 counties in Georgia, and most of them are like East Ellijays Gilmer County: rural and Republican. But roughly 45% of the states population lives in just 10 counties, in the dense urban areas that make up metro Atlanta. These counties have seen a population boom in the last 10-plus years, driven by a swell in young, college-educated, racially and ethnically diverse groups  typically Democratic leaning. When Joe Biden won in 2020, he extended the lead for Democrats in many of these areas, including some counties where, in 2012, and decades prior, a Republican had won. Cobb, Gwinnett and Henry County are three that flipped from Republican to Democrat in 2016. That year, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton narrowly won each county with an average 50.2% of votes. President Biden grew that lead significantly in 2020, averaging 58.1%. These three counties also saw some of the biggest growth and demographic changes over the same period. Gwinnett is Georgias second largest county by population size. In 2010, its population was 50.8% white, 31.3% black, 22.3% Latino and 13.8% Asian, according to Census Bureau data. But by 2020, the percentage of white residents dropped to 35.5% as its population added over 151,000 people. Georgia is a growth state, Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political science professor says. Job prospects are typically what draws the crowd, he said. In Peachtree City, an idyllic suburb in the Republican stronghold of Fayette County, 100 miles of paved multi-use pathways  dominated by golf carts  wind between the citys lakes and tall lush green trees. Amid the picturesque landscape here, south-west of Atlanta, signs of a changing demographic hang from flyers in the local library. Brochures printed in dual languages offer everything from free English classes to linguistically diverse caregivers. Buzzing by the library on a Monday afternoon in her golf cart was Alyona Clement, a 32-year-old from Kazakhstan who last voted for Trump in 2016. Im not voting anymore,"" she said. She has been in Georgia since arriving to the US in 2005, but moved to Peachtree City with her husband and five children in 2020. All the lawsuits that Trump is going through, all these women accusing him of stuff, thats what turned me off from him, Ms Clement said, referring to Trumps legal troubles. In May, Donald Trump became the first US president convicted of a felony for business fraud charges in New York. Hes facing three other criminal cases, including election fraud charges in Georgia. His mugshot was taken in this state. Ms Clement is also not considering President Biden, because of his age and how crazy prices are. There are also voters like Alex Smith, a Fayette County transplant who voted for Joe Biden in 2020, but wasnt living in Georgia at the time. He plans to vote for the president again. Bidens age is an issue, but Trump is just as old, Mr Smith said, with his three-month-old child strapped to his chest and another running around the Peachtree City playground. Mr Smith said he likes Mr Bidens policies and has benefited from the presidents student loan interest reduction programme. Voters like Ms Clement and Mr Smith will likely undermine the Republican hold on Fayette County, where Trumps margin of victory decreased by nearly six points in the last election. Democrats hope gains in areas like this will help to offset declining support for Mr Biden elsewhere in the state. Fayette will be the next county to flip [to Democrats], Prof Bullock said. nan But pollsters and strategists say that for the Biden campaign, there's no escaping the fact that black voters propelled the president to victory in Georgia in 2020, and there are real questions about whether they will do so again. A New York Times and Siena College poll found that in six swing states, including Georgia, 71% of black voters would back Mr Biden in 2024 - a steep drop from the 92% nationally that helped him win the White House at the last election. Underlying the decline is a generational divide among black voters, with young voters showing less support for Mr Biden than their elders. At the Piedmont Park Juneteenth celebration, Khalil Robertson, 30, was pushing his child uphill in a stroller. I probably wont vote for either candidate, he said, pausing under a tree to wipe sweat from his brow. Biden is selling the country and Trump brings out the racists. Its the worst of two evils."
'Local legend' vicar faces losing home of 20 years,"A vicar described by her community as a ""local legend"" faces losing her home of two decades after it was put up for sale. Clair Southgate, a vicar in Box near Bath, has lived in the house for 20 years, but the housing association is now selling it. Ms Southgate, who cannot drive as she has epilepsy and can only manage a few miles by bus, may have to pull out of her volunteer jobs if she is rehoused outside of Box. Housing association GreenSquareAccord said it is committed ""to supporting"" Ms Southgate through the process. Ms Southgate also works as a classroom assistant at the village school, and has served the people of the village through her volunteer roles for more than 30 years. She is what is called a ""self-supporting vicar"" at St Thomas à Becket Church, which is a voluntary role, so she is not entitled to church accommodation. More than 1,400 people have signed a petition to keep Ms Southgate in the village. Speaking about receiving the letter from housing association GreenSquareAccord, Ms Southgate said she ""couldn't speak, really"". ""I could go to work and do the routine things, but I couldn't talk about it to anyone,"" she added. Ms Southgate said the prospect of losing her home of more than two decades makes her feel ""totally gutted"". ""It takes the bottom out of my life,"" she said. ""I know Box is a fantastic community. It always has been and the people in it are amazing. ""But I didn't quite expect the volume of traffic on Facebook and the petition."" Emily Aspin, who has known Ms Southgate for most of her life, said she is an ""essential part of Box village"". Mrs Aspin was hospitalised following an accident right before her wedding, which was then almost called off because of the Covid lockdown. ""With 16 hours notice, Clair got the church going and we arranged the whole wedding,"" she said. ""We got married the next day with 10 of us, just before the lockdown came in. ""I'm so grateful she made that special effort for us."" Rose and Paul Ledbury, who have known Clair for 32 years, said: ""Everybody in the village goes to Clair to do anything. ""Funerals, weddings, christenings, she's just the go to person."" GreenSquareAccord told the BBC that a survey was conducted on the condition of Ms Southgate's home, and ""it was clear the level of long-term investment needed to bring the property up to the right standard would not represent a responsible investment"". ""We recognise this news has been distressing for Mrs Southgate and we are committed to supporting her during this process,"" they said. We are already in discussions with Mrs Southgate about available housing options and will support her to find a new home which meets her needs. ""We would like to be clear that she will not need to leave until we have worked with her to find a new home. She will be eligible for compensation, and we will cover expenses associated with her move."" GreenSquareAccord added that while the decision ""may appear unfair in isolation"", it has a ""limited pot of funding"" with which it maintains the 25,000 homes it owns and manages across England. Where the cost of investing to bring a property up to the right standards for our customer cannot be justified, the responsible decision is to sell that property and support the customer who lives in the property to move on to a suitable alternative - this is a standard part of the work of housing associations,"" they said. Matt Stone, vicar of the Lidbrook Group, said: ""I am grateful to the church and village community for stepping out to stand in solidarity with Clair. My heartfelt prayers are with Clair and her family, and I sincerely hope that a solution can be found. ""We will be working with the Acting Archdeacon of Malmesbury and the Diocesan Support Services to support Clair in this difficult time and assist the communities of St Thomas à Becket Church and Box Cof E Primary School in the days ahead.""

'Mr Pothole' wants action on road surface damage,"A man is waging war on potholes which he says are blighting a Devon town. Dave Newcombe's efforts to prompt the council into action have earned him the nickname of Tavistock's Mr Pothole. Mr Newcombe gathers information on the locations of damage to the road surface and contacts Devon County Council. Devon County Council said its rural road network was more vulnerable to potholes and the wet winter weather had played a part. The condition of roads in Devon was raised by people getting in touch with the BBC via Your Voice, Your Vote to tell us about the most important issues for them during this election. Mr Newcombe said: ""There are numerous potholes all over the town. They do not seem to be dealt with in a reasonable fashion. ""They do very poor repairs which do not last, and it's very frustrating for everyone in the town."" Mr Newcombe set up a Facebook page for people to share information on potholes in Tavistock which has more than 700 members. He said it was difficult to get Devon County Council to take action due to the way it decided which road defects could be repaired. The council's website said it prioritised potholes that were 30cm (12in) wide with a 4cm (1.5in) ""vertical edge"" as it ""cannot afford to fix all of the problems that are reported to us"". Mr Newcombe said the council's definition was strict enough to amount to a ""golden get out of jail card"". Devon County Council previously said it had a £200m pothole repair backlog. A spokesman for Devon County Council said its road network was largely rural with many ""structurally poor"" minor roads meaning ""a high proportion of the network is more vulnerable and susceptible to the formation of potholes"". The council said: ""As weve seen over the last 18 months, the road network deteriorates rapidly during periods of extended wet weather or freezing temperatures."" Political parties have promised to tackle potholes in the run-up to the general election. The Conservatives have promised to take £8.3bn reallocated from the cancellation of the second phase of HS2 and put that money into road repairs over the next 10 years. Labour has pledged to fund councils to repair up to a million potholes a year in England through ""multi-year funding settlements to local leaders"". The Liberal Democrats say they will invest £300m over the course of the next parliament, which they claim will fix 1.2-million potholes a year. The Greens said they would oppose all new road building plans and reallocate funding earmarked for road building to improve public transport, cycleways and footpaths. Reform wants to improve rail and road links but has not addressed potholes specifically. You can see a full list of candidates for all of Devon's constituencies here.

'My addiction wanted me dead until I found hope',"Mr Hayward said: ""It turns out that addiction affects thousands, millions of people. Every single day, come the evening I'd be shaking, I'd be sweating, the dry heaving would start. ""And the only thing that stopped it was to take a drink of alcohol."" Mr Hayward said it was like ""every night for a few years"" but despite that he was still caring for his brother, helping his parents and carrying on. ""But looking back, I wasn't really with it, because all the time I was just thinking, When can I get my next drink,"" he said. If you are affected by issues raised in this article, help is available at BBC Action Line. Once Mr Hayward's addiction escalated to the point where he was drinking more than a litre of vodka every day, he began looking for local services that could help him. In desperation I began Googling anywhere that could stop the pain that I was in, and Abbeycare came up. It's just changed my life, I finally realised what alcoholism is, that its an illness, and how I can live with that illness, and manage it,"" he said. Mr Hayward stayed at Abbeycare twice in 2022 where he underwent a full detox and began to learn more about his condition. Mr Hayward said: ""By the time I got into my mid-20s, things got so bad that I couldn't really function without a drink. I've learnt that there is a way that you can live with the illness, just like many other illnesses, as long as you continue with ongoing treatment, keeping it away."" Mr Hayward says he would ""start drinking vodka"" to get going. ""The drinking got to blackouts where I wouldn't remember the night before,"" he said. He has continued his recovery by taking part in the clinics aftercare programme, which helps to reduce the risk of a relapse. Mr Haywood has re-entered education and is about to begin his final year of a degree in IT and computing with business. Eddie Clarke, outreach manager of the Abbeycare Group, said: Johns story is a timely reminder of the devastation that alcohol addiction can cause. Abbeycares aftercare programme is one of the most important elements of what we offer, as it ensures that our patients have constant support as they navigate their recoveries. Unfortunately there will be many other people in situations like the one John faced, where alcohol is controlling their lives and damaging their health.

A student who was drinking more than a litre of vodka every day has described how his life was turned around after attending a rehab clinic. John Hayward, 30, from Gloucester, began drinking socially when he was a teenager and later started using alcohol as a coping mechanism during a period of poor mental health. After his addiction started dominating his life, he checked himself into Abbeycare, a residential drug and alcohol addiction recovery clinic in Minsterworth, Gloucestershire. My addiction wanted me dead - I thought nobody else felt the way I did, I thought it was just me,"" Mr Hayward said.

If you are affected by issues raised in this article, help is available at BBC Action Line. Once Mr Hayward's addiction escalated to the point where he was drinking more than a litre of vodka every day, he began looking for local services that could help him. In desperation I began Googling anywhere that could stop the pain that I was in, and Abbeycare came up. It's just changed my life, I finally realised what alcoholism is, that its an illness, and how I can live with that illness, and manage it,"" he said. Mr Hayward stayed at Abbeycare twice in 2022 where he underwent a full detox and began to learn more about his condition. Mr Hayward said: ""By the time I got into my mid-20s, things got so bad that I couldn't really function without a drink. I've learnt that there is a way that you can live with the illness, just like many other illnesses, as long as you continue with ongoing treatment, keeping it away."" Mr Hayward says he would ""start drinking vodka"" to get going. ""The drinking got to blackouts where I wouldn't remember the night before,"" he said. He has continued his recovery by taking part in the clinics aftercare programme, which helps to reduce the risk of a relapse. Mr Haywood has re-entered education and is about to begin his final year of a degree in IT and computing with business. Eddie Clarke, outreach manager of the Abbeycare Group, said: Johns story is a timely reminder of the devastation that alcohol addiction can cause. Abbeycares aftercare programme is one of the most important elements of what we offer, as it ensures that our patients have constant support as they navigate their recoveries. Unfortunately there will be many other people in situations like the one John faced, where alcohol is controlling their lives and damaging their health.

'Opening Nando's doesn't give kids things to do',"Mr Lathbury, who has lived in Chippenham his whole life,  said: ""Public services are not working, but then public services aren't working anywhere."" He said young people had been ""forgotten"", citing a youth centre that used to be in the town that was pulled down to be turned into a car park. ""If you constantly don't invest in the youth, you constantly have problems,"" he added. ""Building a Nando's doesn't resolve kids having something to do."" The postman said rent for buildings is currently ""astronomical"", ensuring ""nothing can thrive"". ""For me, [councils should] make everything affordable, make it so a young people can open a business here and run a business from here,"" he said. Mr Lathbury said if paying bills was ""achievable"" people could make an ""honest living"". He believes the ""whole country's in turmoil"", adding: ""We're about to burst. ""I want whoever gets in to do whatever they say they're going to do and make a difference. ""I want them to hold local council to more account - you've had this amount of money, where's it gone?"" Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) senior research economist, Kate Ogden, told the BBC Today programme all of the main party's manifestos are ""almost silent"" on council funding. She said: We saw really huge austerity for councils during the 2010s and even though theyve had funding increasing faster than inflations since about 2019, theyve still not made up for those really big cuts to services. So across things like youth services, leisure and culture, libraries, transport, lots of those services are still having more than 40% less spent on them, than they were per person in 2010. So the effects of those cuts are very much still evident in the way councils are spending. The Conservatives have said they will further strengthen communities by providing 105 towns with a £20m endowment fund for local people to change their town's future. They will extend their Community Ownership Fund and the UK Shared Prosperity Fund and continue backing Investment Zones across the country, giving areas £160m for local growth and investment. Labour has said it will transfer power out of Westminster and into communities with landmark devolution legislation. Towns and cities will be able to take hold of the tools they need to pursue growth, create jobs, and improve living standards.  The party said it will provide capacity and support to councils, and will overhaul the local audit system, so taxpayers get better value for money. The Liberal Democrats said they will tackle the funding crisis facing local authorities, including by providing multi-year settlements, boosting the supply of social housing, and forging a long-term, cross-party agreement on social care. They said they will end the top-down reorganisation of councils and the imposition of elected mayors on communities who do not want them. The Green Party has said it will propose an uplift of 3.5bn a year plus an additional 1bn a year for local grassroots sport and culture. In addition they are proposing an uplift in both education and social care spending which will also go some way to lift some of the wider challenges to local authority finances.

'Pee paint' deployed to stop public urination,"The pee paint was previously used in Headingley in response to the behaviour of some participants of the famous Otley Run pub crawl, the council said. The Otley Run route, which includes parts of Headingley and Hyde Park, is the subject of a Public Space Protection Order, meaning people can be fined up to £1,000 for offences such as public urination. Mr Pryor, who represents the ward of Headingley and Hyde Park, said the paint had originally been introduced in Leeds by Al Garthwaite, the city's then Lord Mayor. He added that it ""felt like the right time for another round of urine paint"". The paint, which was not visible once applied, was being used in ""key spots where we know it happens"", Mr Pryor said. However, he was tight-lipped on exact locations, meaning would-be public urinators could get a nasty surprise. ""We have still got a little bit more.

'The prospect of losing my home is killing me',"A 70-year-old resident living on a council estate due for demolition has said the prospect of losing her home of 40 years has been ""killing her"". Cambridge City Council wants to knock down the majority of the council homes on Ekin Road, Cambridge, and voted in favour of a partial redevelopment last week. The decision has split residents' opinion, with some wanting several homes to be given a reprieve, while others said every property should be demolished. The authority said: ""We will work with all residents to provide support that suits their individual circumstances."" Lynda Kopper, a semi-retired kitchen worker, has lived in the north-east corner of Ekin Road since 1984. She said: ""I love it. It's quiet, peaceful, a sanctuary. This is where my children have grown up - they don't want to lose it."" Of the 122 homes on the 1940s estate, the local authority said 14 houses towards the south of the estate would not be demolished. Ms Kopper's home was not one of them. ""The prospect of losing it is killing me - I can't start again - what am I going to do? I want to live out the rest of my days here,"" she said. Darren Easton, a 56-year-old first responder has lived in one of the flats for the past five years. His home will be demolished following last week's decision by the council's housing scrutiny committee but he described it as ""wonderful news"". ""Every single property should be demolished to let Ekin Road have a new lease of life,"" he said. His sentiments were echoed by 34-year-old Jemma Black, a self-employed housekeeper. ""I have been renting here for just over three years. I understand why the flats need to be demolished,"" she said. ""I love my flat, but have seen a lot of the others and they're horrible."" The decision on whether or not to demolish the estate has waged on for several years. Academic Maurice Chiodo, 40, who runs the Save Ekin Road Campaign Group, said he was happy with the decision to save the row of 14 homes, including his. But he has now called for a further six homes on the estate to be saved, including Ms Kopper's. He said: ""These are people's long standing family homes. Many of them are quite vulnerable. Re-housing for them would be extremely harmful."" A spokesperson for Cambridge City Council said: ""We understand how upsetting this must be for households who would like to stay, but we will work with all residents to provide support that suits their individual circumstances."" The city council redevelopment report said the plans would include 131 ""mixed-tenure"" homes. Follow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

'There is a dental crisis and voters deserve better',"Mrs Widdison, a retired teacher from Watton in Norfolk, said her teeth were ""crumbling"" and that people like her were ""suffering in silence"". She said she could not afford private treatment and did not want to discuss the extreme measures that she had taken, as she was worried it might influence others. ""We are not in Victorian England,"" she added. ""People are resorting to doing things that mean they'll end up in an accident and emergency department."" She said she got through the day by taking painkillers and ""just prayed the day came to an end"" and she could get to sleep. Mrs Widdison said she had been left with ""stumps"" and had to prepare herself a contraption to support the tooth that caused her pain if she wanted to talk. She said it was ""a humiliation"" to walk outside and added: ""You spit, it is not nice at all. ""My chances of ever getting a job or contributing to the community I love, is zero."" Kevin Paul, 65, a welder from Mattishall in Norfolk said his friend couldn't get emergency dental care for six days. He said together, they had spent more than £6,000 on private dental care in two years. Mr Paul felt they had paid national insurance for 45 years, so should not need to budget for dental care. ""We're getting to retirement age and we're having to pay this money out which seems so unfair,"" he said. Mr Paul said he hadn't been able to spend money ""on a holiday or changing the car,"" ""It's quite a bit of money we can't afford,"" he added.

The tree surgeon, who now travelled abroad to see a dentist in Bulgaria every two years, said it was considerably cheaper than paying private prices in England.

He said he was so pleased with the work, which stopped his pain, that his wife was joining him next time. ""I feel it takes the strain off the NHS in this country,"" he added. ""Going private helps and travelling abroad is a good solution. I think by going to Bulgaria it saves having to take their workforce."" Mr Crotty believed the government after the election would find it difficult to get dentists to work in the NHS, for less money and more stress. ""I think one of the solutions might be to train people and pay for their university fees, then perhaps they could be contracted to work for the NHS for a couple of years,"" he suggested. Chris Kelly co-owns private practice Leiston Dental Care in Suffolk. He said it was too difficult to find dentists to work in the NHS and the problems were as much about conditions as salary. He claimed it was normal in the NHS to see 30-50 patients a day. ""They need to get rid of the target driven mentality so we can spend more time with our patients,"" he said. ""It needs to be funded in the same way as a GP practice. We need a pot of money to see a certain number of patients in a town, rather than being paid for a band of procedures. ""I think dentists would return to the NHS in droves if it was funded in that way."" Mr Kelly said he felt the system disincentivised dentists to see new patients who needed a lot of work. The Toothless campaign began in Suffolk 2021 after the last dental practice in Leiston went private. Since then, it has grown to 16 lobby groups across the country. Founder Mark Jones said the oral health of the country was ""on the floor"" and was concerned people could die from dental sepsis without treatment. ""Politicians need to be a lot more radical,"" he said. ""Only 50% of the population has funding for their oral health. It's like saying only half of the population can get a GP. ""They need to shift the dial and get it fully funded."" Mr Jones thinks dental hygienists and therapists should be brought into the NHS and said the budget needed to double.

It said it would provide 700,000 more urgent dental appointments and supervised tooth brushing for three to five year olds. The Liberal Democrats said it would fix the broken dental contract. It said it would ensure an NHS dentist for everyone needing urgent or emergency care, scrap VAT on children's toothbrushes and toothpaste and introduce supervised toothbrushing for children. The Green Party were the only party to promise access to an NHS dentist for all. It said it  would commit to an additional £3bn a year by 2030 for dentistry. It said they would introduce a new NHS dentists contract.  It also promised free dental nursing for children and those on low incomes Reform UK did not mention dentistry in its manifesto but said it would give work to private companies to bring down waiting lists, including some abroad.

Pamela Widdison, Kevin Paul and Billy Crotty said they were left in pain after they could not get an NHS dentist. Some found solutions privately, one could not afford it, but they all believed the NHS dental system was in crisis and needed to change. They were among the many people who got in touch with the BBC via Your Voice, Your Vote and said NHS dentistry was the most important issue for them in the general election. ""Our teeth are rotting and decaying and we deserve better,"" Mrs Widdison said. Mrs Widdison, a retired teacher from Watton in Norfolk, said her teeth were ""crumbling"" and that people like her were ""suffering in silence"". She said she could not afford private treatment and did not want to discuss the extreme measures that she had taken, as she was worried it might influence others. ""We are not in Victorian England,"" she added. ""People are resorting to doing things that mean they'll end up in an accident and emergency department."" She said she got through the day by taking painkillers and ""just prayed the day came to an end"" and she could get to sleep. Mrs Widdison said she had been left with ""stumps"" and had to prepare herself a contraption to support the tooth that caused her pain if she wanted to talk. She said it was ""a humiliation"" to walk outside and added: ""You spit, it is not nice at all. ""My chances of ever getting a job or contributing to the community I love, is zero."" Kevin Paul, 65, a welder from Mattishall in Norfolk said his friend couldn't get emergency dental care for six days. He said together, they had spent more than £6,000 on private dental care in two years. Mr Paul felt they had paid national insurance for 45 years, so should not need to budget for dental care. ""We're getting to retirement age and we're having to pay this money out which seems so unfair,"" he said. Mr Paul said he hadn't been able to spend money ""on a holiday or changing the car,"" ""It's quite a bit of money we can't afford,"" he added. Billy Crotty, 42, from Wimpole in Cambridgeshire, previously knocked a tooth out and said his mouth was in a bad state as he did not have an NHS dentist. The tree surgeon, who now travelled abroad to see a dentist in Bulgaria every two years, said it was considerably cheaper than paying private prices in England. ""I paid around £80 for a root canal treatment compared to £1,200 in this country,"" he said. ""I also had three implants which were £500 compared to £2,000 each here."" He said he was so pleased with the work, which stopped his pain, that his wife was joining him next time. ""I feel it takes the strain off the NHS in this country,"" he added. ""Going private helps and travelling abroad is a good solution. I think by going to Bulgaria it saves having to take their workforce."" Mr Crotty believed the government after the election would find it difficult to get dentists to work in the NHS, for less money and more stress. ""I think one of the solutions might be to train people and pay for their university fees, then perhaps they could be contracted to work for the NHS for a couple of years,"" he suggested. Chris Kelly co-owns private practice Leiston Dental Care in Suffolk. He said it was too difficult to find dentists to work in the NHS and the problems were as much about conditions as salary. He claimed it was normal in the NHS to see 30-50 patients a day. ""They need to get rid of the target driven mentality so we can spend more time with our patients,"" he said. ""It needs to be funded in the same way as a GP practice. We need a pot of money to see a certain number of patients in a town, rather than being paid for a band of procedures. ""I think dentists would return to the NHS in droves if it was funded in that way."" Mr Kelly said he felt the system disincentivised dentists to see new patients who needed a lot of work. The Toothless campaign began in Suffolk 2021 after the last dental practice in Leiston went private. Since then, it has grown to 16 lobby groups across the country. Founder Mark Jones said the oral health of the country was ""on the floor"" and was concerned people could die from dental sepsis without treatment. ""Politicians need to be a lot more radical,"" he said. ""Only 50% of the population has funding for their oral health. It's like saying only half of the population can get a GP. ""They need to shift the dial and get it fully funded."" Mr Jones thinks dental hygienists and therapists should be brought into the NHS and said the budget needed to double. The Conservatives said it would continue to reform the dental contract. It said it would ensure that newly qualified dentists work in the NHS for a number of years or pay back training costs. It also said it would boost training places for dentists and other dental professionals by 40%, introduce payments to encourage dentists to work in rural and coastal areas and mobile dental vans. The Labour Party said it would reform the dental contract with a focus on prevention. It said it would provide 700,000 more urgent dental appointments and supervised tooth brushing for three to five year olds. The Liberal Democrats said it would fix the broken dental contract.

'There was no preparation': One marine's story of defending Kharkiv,"Despite limited supplies, minimal gains and mounting losses, Kyiv insists its southern foothold on the occupied eastern bank of Dnipro River is still significant. Its where Oleksiy had been fighting for the past eight months. Weve agreed not to reveal his real name. We last spoke with him six months ago, where he described the conditions on the swampy riverside as hell. Things havent improved. Wed managed to maintain the bridgehead, but no equipment has crossed it, and we havent once broken through Russian defences, he says. The marine tells us the area had been reduced to a moonscape, with entire villages being razed to their foundations. The Ukrainians have also suffered heavy losses there too. We destroyed a lot of Russian equipment, and they destroyed a lot of our personnel, he says. Weve left our best guys on the riverside. Despite minimal progress and mounting losses, Ukraines military says its pursuing three aims with this bridgehead: Oleksiy says promised US military aid was gradually starting to arrive, but not all of it was making it to the front line where he was based. Despite partially forcing the Russians back, Ukrainian troops still endure constant Russian fire. Any movement was immediately covered by artillery or drones, he explains. The Russians didnt seem concerned by our presence there either; we had become a suitcase without a handle. The troops there cant leave, and everyone understands thats useless. Its hoped a new mobilisation law, which came into force last month, will help give troops like those fighting on the eastern bank a rest. It wont change anything! says Boston, a flamethrower unit commander who is still fighting on the eastern bank. Boston is his military code name. He sends us videos of him on patrol in Krynky by the riverside. At one point he shoots a Russian anti-personnel mine hidden beneath the sand. People should join the army from 20, he says. But there is a problem, a lot of men went abroad [to escape the draft]. No-one wants to come back, no-one wants to fight, and no-one wants to die. We put their testimonies to Dmytro Pletenchuk, the spokesman for Ukraines South Defence Forces. Compared to Russian losses, ours are significantly smaller, he explains. Secondly, we lose soldiers on this part of the front line no more than in other areas."" By definition, a conscript will never be as motivated as a volunteer. Its also easier to inspire troops when fighting is going your way. For Ukraine, and especially on the eastern bank, it isnt. Its possibly why Mr Pletenchuk strikes a sympathetic tone when we tell him about allegations of troop disobedience on the eastern bank. Those who have been forced to defend their country are yesterdays civilians, says Mr Pletenchuk with a smile. They will of course have a different perception of the army."" Ahead of the arrival of more Western military aid, Ukrainian generals believe Russia is trying to expand the battlefield and further stretch their defending units. Invading troops are more than a month into a north-eastern ground offensive, and while Ukraine has slowed their advances, theres been no letting up. Its why Oleksiy now finds himself hundreds of kilometres away from the Kherson region. Everything happened in a hurry and there was no preparation, he says. Everyone is here: marines, air assault forces, the State Border Guard Service, regular infantry, territorial defence and national police. There are also more drones in the sky compared to the east bank of the Dnipro. Moscow is currently on top in this industrialised conflict, with Kyiv struggling to counter its manpower, weaponry, and tactics. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky concedes time is running out for a diplomatic solution which favours Ukraine, which is why he recently held a peace summit in Switzerland. It was about building global support for peace on his terms. While almost 80 countries signed the agreement in Geneva then - and more have since - important regional powers in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia have not. Russia wasnt invited, but before the meeting, Vladimir Putin had demanded Ukrainian troops withdraw from four regions which he partially occupies. His conditions are as maximalist as they are unrealistic, but his battlefield dominance means a potential peace deal could better match his terms than Kyivs. President Zelensky admits his priority is to simply hold the front line. If his troops manage that before the arrival of autumn and more difficult fighting conditions, it would be viewed as a success. Also, he claims there are still plans for a counter offensive in the future. If Oleksiy survives defending the Kharkiv region, he could find himself back at Ukraines hellish river crossing in the south. Additional reporting by Anastasiia Levchenko and Hanna Chornous"
"'We didn't recognise the signs of epilepsy,' family says","The retired company director, based between Chippenham and Malmesbury, also hopes to raise money for Epilepsy Research Institute. He devised the fundraiser after conversations with friends who were unaware about the impact of the condition. As a family we felt we had to do something to raise awareness of epilepsy, he said. We didnt recognise the initial signs of epilepsy and when we told people about Elizas diagnosis the responses were so similar: So sorry to hear that, but Im sure medication will sort that out? ""As we know, for some, thats far from reality. There are more than 630,000 people in the UK with a known epilepsy diagnosis, according to the Epilepsy Research Institute. One third of people with epilepsy live with seizures that do not respond to medication. In 65% of cases, the cause of a persons epilepsy remains unknown. More research was needed to better understand the causes and to improve treatments for everyone with epilepsy, the institute said. The impact of epilepsy goes beyond seizures. Martin said: ""Eliza has struggled with speech for the past couple of years, which has significantly hampered her confidence. ""We have since found out this is often the case with children who have epilepsy, and we had missed several other signs. ""Her speech and reading have improved since she began medication, though she has still been having seizures, and the anxiety around what is happening to her has also increased. The cycling challenge will take place in two parts: the team of family and friends will initially cycle 500 miles on the road, at home on a bike trainer, or by whatever means necessary. Martin will then cycle the other 500 miles from Elizas house in West Wales to his house in Beaux Village, France. Her grandfather has only been cycling since the pandemic and also has asthma and said: This challenge is massive for me."" The family say they hope to achieve three things with the challenge. They want parents to gain a better understanding of epilepsy so that the first signs of the condition can be recognised sooner. Secondly, they are campaigning for more research to be carried out into the causes of epilepsy. Finally, they want to see improvements in medication so that the number of people being successfully treated for seizures can be moved from around 65%, as it is now, to 100%.

'Which party will ensure councils do not go bust?',"Ms Johnston said she was prompted to write to the BBC after seeing its Panorama programme about the Thurrock Council financial scandal. ""What concerns me is there's lots of talk about more investment in social care and housing. The government will give this money to the councils but how do we know it will be spent on the right things?"" she said. ""I'd like to know what government is going to do to support councils so that poor decisions don't see residents penalised and services cut drastically."" So what do the parties have to say on the issue? The Conservatives plan to ensure councils provide high quality and value for money services to local communities. ""As part of this, we will protect residents from excessive council tax rises by ensuring that local people have the final say on council tax; and we will ban the four-day working week in local authorities. ""We will improve standards in councils by making their performance more transparent through the Office for Local Government."" The party adds it will ""always stand behind councils"". Labour says local government has been facing ""acute financial challenges and to provide greater stability, a Labour government will give councils multi-year funding settlements and end wasteful competitive bidding."" Its manifesto adds: ""Labour will provide capacity and support to councils, and will overhaul the local audit system, so taxpayers get better value for money."" The Liberal Democrats acknowledge many local authorities are facing a ""financial crisis"" and, like Labour, plan to introduce multi-year settlements. The party says it will ""support local government through these difficult times, and review the burdens and costs that councils have shouldered"". The party's plans for social care provision, led by councils, includes ""forging a long-term, cross-party agreement on social care"", which could mean more scrutiny, given the involvement of all parties on any council. The Greens believe all communities should make their own decisions. ""Elected Greens will ensure that local authorities across England are given the powers and resources they need,"" its manifesto says. ""They will push for an increase in local government funding of £5bn per year to tackle the current under-funding crisis and enable local authorities to play a key role in the transition to a zero-carbon economy and protecting nature."" No mention is made of scrutiny of spending decisions. On to Reform, which does not mention its plans for council funding or local authorities in its manifesto. Where do councils get their money from? The way in which local government is funded has also changed over the past 13 years. Councils used to get most of their money from central government, but now it is mainly from local sources. This includes council tax, retained business rates and charges for services like parking, swimming pools and planning applications. It has also involved more commercial investments, which is where some councils have got into difficulty. Councils' spending power has also reduced with the Local Government Association saying councils' spending power has dropped 27% since 2010. Authorities must provide some services, like social care, by law, so meeting the increased demand means cuts elsewhere. Councils are also required by law to have a balanced budget each financial year and provide ""best value"" to residents. But more and more councils are finding it harder to do so.

'Why I'm photographing every London Chinese takeaway',"""I just had that intense feeling of being taken right back to when I was seven years old, just hearing the woks going. ""In a Chinese takeaway kids aren't trusted with anything else other than putting the lids on the boxes and the food's burning hot, and just all those memories came flooding back in that moment,"" she says. The following night the 49-year-old returned to Leyton but this time with her camera, and she started taking pictures of the outside of the takeaway, along with other Chinese eateries in the area. These evening journeys have since spread further around London from her base in Walthamstow, each night plotted in advance to take in as many establishments as possible in a certain area. The images are then documented on Instagram under the pseudonym Jing Soeng, meaning ""to take a photograph"" in Cantonese. ""It's got really addictive actually,"" she laughs. ""My step-count's got pretty high."" Noodle shops were initially developed by Chinese communities around some UK ports around the early 1900s, but over the decades the number of Chinese eateries increased, before booming in the years after World War Two to become ever-present on streets across the country. As the number of establishments rose so did the dishes they served develop, with chips and curry sauce mingling with chow mein and crispy duck to appeal to British palates - much to the disgust of TikTok in recent years. But it is this melting point of tastes which drew Armstrong, who by day works as a medical photographer for the NHS, to her project. ""My dual identity has always been quite complex,"" the artist explains. ""I've always felt that I'm a bit stuck somewhere between my Britishness and Chineseness, but also feeling a bit like I'm on the outside of both."" She believes this complexity developed as she grew up. ""I was probably the only Chinese person in my class at the time, and there was a lot of prejudice and a bit of ignorance from my peers. And then when I was learning to speak English, my family actually didn't like it because they thought it was becoming too English. ""So it's that kind of really weird space,"" she says. Armstrong therefore sees the project as a way to ""re-establish my connection between my British and Chinese parts"", but in light-hearted way. ""I've actually become to really embrace that and I think the Chinese takeaway to me represents where East meets West,"" she says. Armstrong also sees her artwork as a way to ""document a slice of history from my culture"" as she worries that changes in society are threatening those familiar takeaway sights of a fading yellow menu in the window and noodles being piled into foil trays. ""My generation of British born Chinese are not wanting to do the ridiculous hours or want to work in a Chinese takeaway like the generation before us,"" she says. The increasing use of delivery couriers also means that some takeaways do not present themselves in ways to appeal to people passing by on the street any more, the photographer adds. ""They're almost like factories and I've been getting a bit worried thinking oh no that's a whole part my heritage starting to disappear, so I feel a slight urgency as well to get around as many as I can."" As such Armstrong is encouraging people to recommend their favourite Chinese takeaway in London to her on Instagram to include in her artwork, with potential plans to further expand the project to other parts of the UK in time. ""I just see them as these brightly lit beacons - they're very inviting and there's a whole life going on behind there.""

'You don't expect your children to take their lives',"The 66-year-old said she struggled not to feel like she had ""let them down"" and said their deaths were ""heartbreaking"". Ms Kordek died in 2018 and her brother died in 2023, both were aged 44. She said: ""Tanya made the decision she didn't want to live, she went on the road to self-destruction."" Her daughter had made repeated suicide attempts but her death was ""still horrible and left me in a world of disbelief,"" she said. Mrs Kelly said her son Stevie took his sister's death ""particularly hard"" as the two were like ""twins of different ages"". ""I spent her life trying to keep her alive and protect her, she was my baby, beautiful, my first born. ""But then Stevie died and it ripped my heart out."" Mr Kordek, who had struggled with addiction, had seemed to turn his life around, and had been sober for four years when he died, she said. Mrs Kelly said as a result his death was completely unexpected. In July 2023 he suddenly presented at hospital feeling suicidal but was sent home with advice that someone would call him. He had no contact with mental health services before he was found dead six days later at home, she told the BBC. After both her children died, Mrs Kelly said she was inundated by people saying they pair had helped them with their own mental health struggles. ""All that kindness they had but they weren't kind to themselves, they didn't see their worth and their beauty. ""I describe my life now as I have lost two of the most precious things in the world, my babies, and I am walking in their shoes,"" she said. Mrs Kelly urged others to look at the reasons a person might be struggling, rather than making assumptions. ""Drugs, homelessness, alcoholism, eating disorders, all mental health, these are addictions or symptomatic of a bigger problem. ""I wish people were more open about it. ""With chicken pox or pregnancy, you can see it. But mental health, it's silent, you don't see it. You don't wear a badge saying be gentle with me,"" she said. Since her children died, Mrs Kelly has focused on raising awareness and funds for mental health charities. She hopes to raise £10,000 through events at Pure Colours tattoo in St Albans in which people donate money in exchange for a tattoo. She said: ""It keeps me focused and stops me rocking in a corner grieving for my babies."" More than 300 people have had tattoos at previous events, raising £6,400 to date.

'You have to be a bit nuts to be a tennis star',"Jack showed a precocious tennis talent from an early age, surprising his mother by hitting a ball against the garage door when he was aged just one. A left-handed player despite doing everything else with his right, he was three when he started tennis coaching with his mums toddler group at Sutton Tennis and Squash Club. By the time Jack was five he was being coached by Justin Sherring at Weybridge Tennis Academy, who would visit his young protégé twice a week at Parkside School for tennis lessons. Assistant head Alex Gainer remembers a magical moment during the schools ""Road to Wimbledon"" tournament, where an eight-year-old Jack outplayed an opponent who was five years older. The whole school and all the teachers [were] watching this one titanic match,"" he said. ""No one went back to class, everyone finished the game off properly - it was an amazing moment for the school and people to remember, when Jack beat that older boy and he could go on to do good things."" Jack's success at tennis is very much a family affair. Nicky Draper, herself a junior tennis champion, helps with her son's accounts and his older brother Ben is his manager. His maternal grandmother, Brenda, introduced the family to tennis, while grandfather Chris describes himself as obsessed with Jack's progress. Even Ozzy the dog helps out, according to the family. Its really nice to have people who you love - and you know they have your back at every turn - around you on a day-to-day basis,"" Jack said. ""Thats what keeps the feet on the ground, thats what keeps you motivated and ultimately keeps you sane in the sport. He added that ""part of the reason Ive got to this stage is that Ive been fortunate enough to have an older brother I was able to hit with and compete against - have that sibling rivalry. ""I remember when we were younger the only time we played against each other, he beat me and that just killed me, even though hes four years older than me. Jack describes himself as calm and genuine, adding with a chuckle, I think Ive always been a good boy"". ""If you asked the people around me theyd probably say, Im a little bit nuts. In all honesty, being a professional athlete, especially being a tennis player, you have to be a bit nuts,"" he said.

Alex Balls, deputy head at Reeds School in Cobham, said: I think Jack on his day is good enough to beat anyone.

In the space of a few days, Jack won his first major tournament in Stuttgart, became Britains highest ranked tennis player, defeated the reigning Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz at Queens and was selected for Team GB at the Paris Olympics. His mother, Nicky, who is a tennis coach at Parkside School in Cobham, acknowledged that things have intensified a bit for her son. Meanwhile, in a BBC interview, Jack admitted that to be a professional tennis player, you have to be a bit nuts. The tennis star, who enters the Wimbledon tournament ranked as one of the top 30 players in the world, has been drawn against Swedens Elias Ymer, ranked 206, in the first round, which starts on Monday.

11th strike of junior doctor pay dispute begins,"The NHS Confederation said striking during the election campaign, when none of the political parties was in a position to resolve the dispute, was a ""bitter pill to swallow"". The government and BMA had agreed to independent arbitration, in May, but that was put on hold when the election was called - and the union then called the strike. It has asked for a 35% rise, to make up for what it says are 15 years of below-inflation pay rises. Junior doctors received a pay rise averaging nearly 9% in the last financial year. The BMA last year walked out of talks in which an extra 3% pay rise on top was discussed. Junior doctors make up nearly half the medical workforce in the NHS and two-thirds of them are BMA members, so NHS England is warning of significant disruption, pointing out the health service is already under extra pressure this week due to the hot weather. Yellow heat alerts announced for many parts of the country indicate the weather could pose a risk to those particularly vulnerable. It can cause heat-stroke and exhaustion as well as worsening respiratory and heart problems. The latest strike will see junior doctors walk out of all services, with senior doctors drafted in to provide cover. It is expected to cause most disruption to elective services in hospital, such as routine operations. NHS England has urged the public to use the health service responsibly - but people should still use 999 for emergencies and NHS 111 for urgent needs. Those with routine appointments and treatments should attend unless told otherwise, NHS England said. GP services and pharmacies will also be available. nan Medical director Stephen Powis said he expected this latest strike to hit the NHS very hard. And Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health leaders, criticised its timing. While we fully understand the genuine grievances junior doctors have over their pay, conditions and training, NHS leaders will still be frustrated that they will yet again be taking to the picket lines,"" he said. Holding strikes in the middle of an election campaign, when no political party is in a position to bring the dispute to a close, is a bitter pill to swallow for staff who have to plug the gaps and patients who will have their appointments cancelled or delayed. Nearly 1.5 million appointments and operations have been cancelled because of strike action in the NHS in England, at an estimated cost of £3bn. nan nan Anita Wheeler, 75, a former nurse from Reading, is one of those that has had care postponed because of the dispute. She has a condition called plantar fasciitis which causes her pain in her ankle and foot. Her trauma and orthopaedics outpatient appointment for her foot was cancelled because of the junior doctors strike in March 2023. She says she sympathises with people in the same position this time around. I've been in this position before, so I know what its like, you build yourself up and think youre going to get treated and then they turn around and say its cancelled. These delays impact people lives. ""When I found out my appointment was cancelled, I broke down and cried. The BMA said the blame lay at the governments door, criticising it for not once making a credible offer during the dispute. And it was now willing to have the 35% pay rise phased in, after initially calling for it in one go. But ministers have always maintained the demands are unreasonable. All the political parties, including the Conservatives, have said they would want to resolve the dispute if they formed the next government and would be willing to sit down for talks.

A-list stars turn out for awesome Coldplay show,"Is there such a thing as a band thats too big for Glastonbury? If so, Coldplay might be it. People are climbing up scaffolding, security guards are standing on emergency vehicles, actual Tom Cruise is watching from a viewing platform, accompanied by Gillian Anderson and Simon Pegg. Michael J Fox even joins them to play guitar on Fix You. At other stages around Worthy Farm, A-list artists floundered, with some fields barely at one-third capacity. Everyone, it seems, is straining for a glimpse of rocks most generous-spirited band. And Coldplay dont disappoint. nan Like Dua Lipa on Friday night, they understand the brief: You cant turn up to Glastonbury and play the same old festival set. It has to feel special. They start with Yellow. Yes, Yellow. A song any other band would save for the encore. And for the next hour, the hits dont stop: Higher Power, Paradise, The Scientist, Hymn For The Weekend, Viva La Vida. The setlist is stacked. But its more than that. Chris Martin makes it his mission to reach every member of the audience individually. Thats why they give out the wristbands that turn the whole field into a giant LED screen. Thats why there are fireworks every five minutes. Thats why so many of their songs have a bit that goes woaaaaah  even the most casual fan can sing along. During The Scientist, Martin thanks the people whove waited by the front barriers all day. Its amazing that none of you had to pee, he laughs. But he also acknowledges everybody in the middle of the field and the latecomers at the back, five time zones away, in their wellington boots. Thank you for all your flags and the singing and everything. This is our favourite thing to do on earth, so thank you for letting us do it. The production is such an assault on the senses - with all its lasers and giant balloons and confetti cannons - that experiencing it leaves you feeling slightly dizzy. But its exactly that largesse that sets Coldplay apart. Cynics might dismiss it as pandering to the lowest common denominator. I prefer to think of it as generosity. An act of community. It also helps that they have an impenetrable arsenal of hits. Clocks, with its swirling piano hook, is a strangely paranoid stadium anthem (am I part of the cure, or am I part of the disease), while Sky Full Of Stars is a pure sugar-rush of pop perfection. The urgent, propulsive Viva La Vida might tell the story of a deposed despot reminiscing about his glory days, but everyone knows it for the five note oh-ah-woah-oh-oh hook, that rings around the Pyramid Stage long after Coldplay have left. nan But perhaps the most intriguing section came towards the middle of the set, when Coldplay briefly indulged in some new material and deep cuts. It featured the live debut of the song We Pray, featuring Nigerian star Burna Boy and British rapper Little Simz; and a vibrant rendition Arabesque, from 2019s underappreciated Everyday Life album, which included a blistering saxophone solo from African icon Femi Kuti. The latter, in particular, offered a glimpse of how Coldplay could operate outside the confines of stadium rock. But before long, they were back in crowd-pleasing mode, racing through the dance anthems Something Just Like This and My Universe, a collaboration with K-pop supergroup BTS. For the encore, they emerged on a B-stage, where Martin reminisced about their first ever visit to Glastonbury, 25 years ago this month. They played the new band tent, they were late, and they were just the worst (his words, not mine). To celebrate, they played Sparks, a rarely heard acoustic ballad from their debut album, Parachutes. Then, the best moment of the night. nan nan Turning the cameras on the audience, Martin started improvising odes to individual fans. Five handsome men in their tracksuits / Theyve made it to the front of the front section, he sang to one group. They didnt come today / Dressed as Coldplay. They came dressed as One Direction. After a few more ditties, the cameras suddenly cut to Glastonbury co-founder Sir Michael Eavis, prompting a roar of approval from the audience. Again, Martin began to sing. Sir Michael we just want to thank you As humans go youre the best of all sorts Youre a musical charmer Youre the world greatest farmer Whoever got knighted wearing shorts? And just when it seemed like that would be the crowning glory, actor Michael J Fox appeared on screen. The actor, who recently released a documentary about living with Parkinsons, was in a wheelchair, but the audience went wild. Martin explained that the stars 1985 film Back To The Future was ""the main reason why we're in a band"". And Fox joined him onstage to play Fix You on a peach guitar. Every Glastonbury needs a defining moment  and this felt like the one for 2024. This was Coldplays fifth time headlining Glastonbury, after previous stints at the top of the bill in 2002, 2005, 2011 and 2016. Chris Martin previously told the BBC he was wary about returning to the festival after people complained about him making guest appearances during other peoples sets  including Stormzy and Kylie Minogue. ""I saw a tweet afterwards which said, 'You can always rely on him to come on in a tracksuit and ruin everything',"" he recalled. Tonight, that felt like distant history.

Feelslikeimfallinginglove Coldplay were preceded on the Pyramid Stage by Little Simz, playing her only UK show of the year  but if she was rusty, it didnt show. The Londoner staged a hip-hop masterclass that highlighted both her lyrical flex and her magnetic stage presence. She stood alone on stage for the opening salvo of Silhouette, No Merci and I Love You, I Hate You  each of which highlight the independent artists hard-won success. Don't you know I'm God's child? Got here on my own, she rapped on Silhouette. Its a theme she returned to on the nights only new song, The Code, which featured a brilliant clap-back to her detractors: You can move the goalposts and Ill still keep scoring. Having established her credentials, she relaxed a little, bringing out Nigerian singer Obongjayar for the supple Point And Kill before segueing into more mellow songs like Woman and Selfish. The clamour and excitement grew as her set continued. Towards the end, the rapper removed her shades and surveyed the audience, looking visibly moved. This is so mad for me, she said. Ive been doing music since I was knee high and this is by far the most people Ive ever performed in front of. It really is a dream. nan Other sets on the Pyramid Stage on Saturday came from Cyndi Lauper  who suffered from technical issues that affected her vocals  and indie band Keane, marking the 20th anniversary of their chart-topping debut album Hopes and Fears. It changed our lives, said a frontman Tom Chaplin, leading the audience on a full-throated singalong through hits like Somewhere Only We Know, Bedshaped and Everybodys Changing. The Other Stage had an eclectic line-up that included pop star indie heroes Bloc Party, newcomers The Last Dinner Party and pop star Camila Cabello, whose quirky set saw her riding around on a BMX. nan Kasabian played a not-so-secret set at the Woodsies tent, which was filled to bursting point, while pop queen Jessie Ware headlined on West Holts  bringing feel-good disco anthems to a disappointingly small crowd. (Blame Coldplay). She gave it her all, though, hot-stepping through the wonky disco groove of Freak Me Now, and brandishing a microphone stand that doubled as a dominatrix's whip, to the delight of her diehard fans. ""Im here to have a good time, not to earn a good time,"" said one. ""She gave us pure joy."" Elsewhere, Disclosure brought out Sam Smith to play Latch as they headlined The Other Stage, and South Korean DJ Peggy Gou got festivalgoers ready for the all-night dance arenas with an invigorating set on The Park Stage that included a cameo from Sophie Ellis Bextor, singing Murder On The Dancefloor. In other words, there was too much music  and too much variety  for anyone to consume in one day. The entertainment continues on Sunday with R&B star SZA headlining the Pyramid Stage and Shania Twain expected to draw the weekends biggest audience for her mid-afternoon performance in the legend slot.

Chris Martin makes it his mission to reach every member of the audience individually. Thats why they give out the wristbands that turn the whole field into a giant LED screen. Thats why there are fireworks every five minutes. Thats why so many of their songs have a bit that goes woaaaaah  even the most casual fan can sing along. During The Scientist, Martin thanks the people whove waited by the front barriers all day. Its amazing that none of you had to pee, he laughs. But he also acknowledges everybody in the middle of the field and the latecomers at the back, five time zones away, in their wellington boots. Thank you for all your flags and the singing and everything. This is our favourite thing to do on earth, so thank you for letting us do it. The production is such an assault on the senses - with all its lasers and giant balloons and confetti cannons - that experiencing it leaves you feeling slightly dizzy. But its exactly that largesse that sets Coldplay apart. Cynics might dismiss it as pandering to the lowest common denominator. I prefer to think of it as generosity. An act of community. It also helps that they have an impenetrable arsenal of hits. Clocks, with its swirling piano hook, is a strangely paranoid stadium anthem (am I part of the cure, or am I part of the disease), while Sky Full Of Stars is a pure sugar-rush of pop perfection. The urgent, propulsive Viva La Vida might tell the story of a deposed despot reminiscing about his glory days, but everyone knows it for the five note oh-ah-woah-oh-oh hook, that rings around the Pyramid Stage long after Coldplay have left. nan But perhaps the most intriguing section came towards the middle of the set, when Coldplay briefly indulged in some new material and deep cuts. It featured the live debut of the song We Pray, featuring Nigerian star Burna Boy and British rapper Little Simz; and a vibrant rendition Arabesque, from 2019s underappreciated Everyday Life album, which included a blistering saxophone solo from African icon Femi Kuti. The latter, in particular, offered a glimpse of how Coldplay could operate outside the confines of stadium rock. But before long, they were back in crowd-pleasing mode, racing through the dance anthems Something Just Like This and My Universe, a collaboration with K-pop supergroup BTS. For the encore, they emerged on a B-stage, where Martin reminisced about their first ever visit to Glastonbury, 25 years ago this month. They played the new band tent, they were late, and they were just the worst (his words, not mine). To celebrate, they played Sparks, a rarely heard acoustic ballad from their debut album, Parachutes. Then, the best moment of the night. nan nan Turning the cameras on the audience, Martin started improvising odes to individual fans. Five handsome men in their tracksuits / Theyve made it to the front of the front section, he sang to one group. They didnt come today / Dressed as Coldplay. They came dressed as One Direction. After a few more ditties, the cameras suddenly cut to Glastonbury co-founder Sir Michael Eavis, prompting a roar of approval from the audience. Again, Martin began to sing. Sir Michael we just want to thank you As humans go youre the best of all sorts Youre a musical charmer Youre the world greatest farmer Whoever got knighted wearing shorts? And just when it seemed like that would be the crowning glory, actor Michael J Fox appeared on screen. The actor, who recently released a documentary about living with Parkinsons, was in a wheelchair, but the audience went wild. Martin explained that the stars 1985 film Back To The Future was ""the main reason why we're in a band"". And Fox joined him onstage to play Fix You on a peach guitar. Every Glastonbury needs a defining moment  and this felt like the one for 2024. This was Coldplays fifth time headlining Glastonbury, after previous stints at the top of the bill in 2002, 2005, 2011 and 2016. Chris Martin previously told the BBC he was wary about returning to the festival after people complained about him making guest appearances during other peoples sets  including Stormzy and Kylie Minogue. ""I saw a tweet afterwards which said, 'You can always rely on him to come on in a tracksuit and ruin everything',"" he recalled. Tonight, that felt like distant history.

Feelslikeimfallinginglove Coldplay were preceded on the Pyramid Stage by Little Simz, playing her only UK show of the year  but if she was rusty, it didnt show. The Londoner staged a hip-hop masterclass that highlighted both her lyrical flex and her magnetic stage presence. She stood alone on stage for the opening salvo of Silhouette, No Merci and I Love You, I Hate You  each of which highlight the independent artists hard-won success. Don't you know I'm God's child? Got here on my own, she rapped on Silhouette. Its a theme she returned to on the nights only new song, The Code, which featured a brilliant clap-back to her detractors: You can move the goalposts and Ill still keep scoring. Having established her credentials, she relaxed a little, bringing out Nigerian singer Obongjayar for the supple Point And Kill before segueing into more mellow songs like Woman and Selfish. The clamour and excitement grew as her set continued. Towards the end, the rapper removed her shades and surveyed the audience, looking visibly moved. This is so mad for me, she said. Ive been doing music since I was knee high and this is by far the most people Ive ever performed in front of. It really is a dream. nan Other sets on the Pyramid Stage on Saturday came from Cyndi Lauper  who suffered from technical issues that affected her vocals  and indie band Keane, marking the 20th anniversary of their chart-topping debut album Hopes and Fears. It changed our lives, said a frontman Tom Chaplin, leading the audience on a full-throated singalong through hits like Somewhere Only We Know, Bedshaped and Everybodys Changing. The Other Stage had an eclectic line-up that included pop star indie heroes Bloc Party, newcomers The Last Dinner Party and pop star Camila Cabello, whose quirky set saw her riding around on a BMX. nan Kasabian played a not-so-secret set at the Woodsies tent, which was filled to bursting point, while pop queen Jessie Ware headlined on West Holts  bringing feel-good disco anthems to a disappointingly small crowd. (Blame Coldplay). She gave it her all, though, hot-stepping through the wonky disco groove of Freak Me Now, and brandishing a microphone stand that doubled as a dominatrix's whip, to the delight of her diehard fans. ""Im here to have a good time, not to earn a good time,"" said one. ""She gave us pure joy."" Elsewhere, Disclosure brought out Sam Smith to play Latch as they headlined The Other Stage, and South Korean DJ Peggy Gou got festivalgoers ready for the all-night dance arenas with an invigorating set on The Park Stage that included a cameo from Sophie Ellis Bextor, singing Murder On The Dancefloor. In other words, there was too much music  and too much variety  for anyone to consume in one day. The entertainment continues on Sunday with R&B star SZA headlining the Pyramid Stage and Shania Twain expected to draw the weekends biggest audience for her mid-afternoon performance in the legend slot."

Aer Lingus pilots stage eight-hour work stoppage,"Aer Lingus has now cancelled almost 400 flights  up until 7 July as a result of the indefinite work-to-rule and strike action by pilots. The Republic of Irelands Labour Court has invited both parties to a meeting on Monday to review the current situation. Cpt Tighe said the union was ""considering an escalation"" before the invitation, but he was hopeful the court would be able to assist in the dispute. He added the union's mandate is clear and that pilots will not accept work practice changes in exchange for more pay. ""The pilots have clearly stated to us that they are not prepared to sell working conditions to finance a pay increase,"" he said. ""They're not going to pay for a pay increase, particularly when their claim was a reasonable one of inflation to protect their pay."" On the picket line, Cpt Gareth Hanna said strike action was the ""last thing"" pilots want. ""Nobody wants passengers to be put out,"" he told Irish broadcaster RTÉ. Also on strike, First Officer Chloe Halpin called for reform of the company's pay structure. ""I'm new to Aer Lingus and I'm actually on 10% less pay than our other colleagues,"" she said. ""We should only have one pay scale in Aer Lingus, that's why I'm here."" Aer Linguss communications director Olivia Buckley apologised to customers for the disruption. Its been damaging from a reputational point of view for the airline and also from a financial point of view, she told RTÉ. Ongoing industrial action is making it increasingly difficult to find a resolution to the dispute, she added. The Aer Lingus website has a list of flights disrupted because of the strike. The website states that if your flight is affected, you will be contacted by them directly by email or SMS message. Or, if you booked through a travel agent, they will contact you to advise you of your options. The Aer Lingus website said Aer Lingus Regional services to and from Belfast and Great Britain, operated by Emerald Airlines, will not be affected by any industrial relations action and will operate as scheduled. Aer Lingus Regional flight numbers are EI 3000  EI 3999. The airline has said passengers with flights booked between now and 7 July have a number of options available. For customers who have booked directly with Aer Lingus, there is the option to change flights online. The company said it will waive the fare difference and any service fees if rebooking for a later date. There is also the option to request a full refund or a refund voucher, which can be redeemed within five years. Aer Lingus say passengers who booked through third party must contact those companies directly. Capt Mark Tighe previously said that the 24% increase is a ""cumulative figure of inflation from 2019, our last pay rise"". Speaking to BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, Capt Tighe said in an effort to resolve the dispute, the union had said it would accept less than an inflationary rise. ""We dont believe anybody should be getting less than inflation, but yesterday in an effort to resolve this, we said we would accept less than inflation."" However, he added: ""We believe inflation is a very reasonable claim in this current time."" Co-pilots can start out at about 36,000 (£30,400), with packages increasing based on actual flying hours. Irish broadcaster RTÉ has reported a captain at the top of the scale can be paid about 287,000 (£242,000). Capt Mark Tighe explained on Thursday that this can take up to 26 years. There are differences for pilots depending on whether flights are short or long-haul. This has been a long-running dispute over pay, and there have been a lot of announcements. But here are some of the key things that have happened so far this week: Hundreds of striking Aer Lingus pilots have marched at Dublin Airport as part of an ongoing dispute with the airline over pay. The eight-hour strike began at 05:00 local time and ended at 13:00. The pilots, in full uniform, passed the airlines head office before setting up a picket line at the entrance to the airport for a time. Aer Lingus cancelled 120 flights on Saturday with about 17,000 passengers affected and apologised for the disruption. The Irish Airline Pilots' Association (Ialpa) previously called for a 24% pay rise for members, and pilots began a work-to-rule on Wednesday. Ialpa president Captain Mark Tighe said the striking pilots have ""clearly demonstrated their solidarity, their strength [and] their togetherness"". ""We've seen the company cancel up to 20% of flights, we find that astounding actually,"" Cpt Tighe told BBC News NI. He said a ""very small number"" of pilots work on their scheduled days off, as they are often tired and want to spend time with their families. ""The work-to-rule would cause some disruption but we wouldn't expect it to be anything like this, so questions need to asked,"" he said.

Afghanistan: The Taliban's broken promises,"On taking power, the new administration made a series of pledges on women's rights to education, the economy and on tackling drug production. How far have they lived up to these promises? This was Taliban spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, in August 2021. Since then a wide range of strict measures have been re-imposed on women in Afghanistan. In December last year, women were banned from attending university. This followed an existing ban on education for girls beyond the sixth grade (11 to 12-year-olds) imposed soon after the Taliban came to power. According to the UN, around 80% of girls and young women of school age are not in education. The Taliban have also banned women from working in all non-governmental organisations, as well as for the UN, and ordered the closure of beauty salons across the country. Women's participation in the labour force has dropped by 25% between August 2021 and March 2023, according to the International Labour Organization. Amnesty International and the International Commission for Jurists have said that the restrictions on women imposed in Afghanistan could constitute gender persecution under the International Criminal Court. This was another pledge made by spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, soon after the Taliban took control two years ago. Opium is used to make heroin - and Afghanistan has been, by far, the world's largest source of opium for many years. In April 2022, the Taliban announced a ban on the growing of opium poppies - but without setting a deadline. A BBC investigation in June this year found there had been a significant drop in cultivation in Helmand, Nangarhar and Kandahar provinces. In Helmand province, which previously accounted for as much as half of all poppy production, there has been a reduction in the cultivated area from 129,000 hectares in 2022 to 740 hectares in April 2023, according to satellite imagery from UK-based analysts, Alcis. Cultivation has also been significantly cut in Nangarhar - from 7,000 hectares in 2022 to just 865 hectares in 2023. However, in more remote parts of the country, satellite imagery has revealed continued production. Taliban plans for economic growth - expressed here in 2021 by Zabihullah Mujahid - have not been borne out in practice. The suspension of most international aid and the freezing of access to Afghanistan's foreign exchange reserves have had serious economic consequences. In June last year, the UN Security Council estimated that the Afghan economy had contracted by 30%-40% since the Taliban takeover. Despite some limited improvement in economic indicators since then, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) says ""overall, Afghanistan's economic outlook remains very difficult"". ""This will be particularly so,"" it adds, ""if the recent restrictions on women's employment in NGOs lead to a significant drop in international aid, exacerbating pressures on the exchange rate and inflation."" The UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) has recorded a significant fall in violence against civilians since the peak of the conflict in 2016. However, attacks on former Afghan government and security officials, prisoners, women and journalists have continued. According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project (Acled), civilians have been targeted by both the Taliban and rebel groups which oppose them such as the National Resistance Front (NRF), the largest armed anti-Taliban group. ""Attacks on civilians have often taken place in the context of Taliban raids on villages in search of NRF fighters. Civilians accused of supporting the NRF are frequently detained, tortured or killed,"" Acled notes in its latest report. Women have also been the targets of assaults as more restrictions are placed their ability to work, acquire education and move freely in public spaces. A UN survey conducted earlier this year said that 68% women felt their safety was ""very bad"" or ""bad""."

Airport warning for passengers amid M56 closure,"Passengers have been warned to leave extra time travelling to catch flights as sections of a busy motorway close for resurfacing next month. Parts of the M56 by Manchester Airport will be closed overnight on several dates in June and July for ""important wear and tear work"". The work, which includes resurfacing some slip roads, will take place between 21:00 and 05:00 BST on weekdays, ending at 07:00 on weekends. Rob Williams of National Highways said drivers would need to ""leave a little bit of extra time to get to work or check-in for flights"". Work to lay the new surface will begin on 10 June between junction five at the airport and junction six at Hale Barns. The entire eastbound carriageway, between junction six and junction four, will shut overnight on 11 and 12 June, and again between 8 and 10 July, with diversions in place via local roads. Later that month, the eastbound road between junction seven and junction five will shut between 24 and 26 June, and on 4 and 5 July. A full list of the closures can be found on the National Highways website. Mr Williams said the agency was working with Manchester Airport to ""ensure they are aware of our timetable"". Workers should be ""well out of the way"" before the summer holidays begin at the end of July,"" he added.

Anger over postal vote problems,"Mrs Morrison said: ""I've voted in every general election since I've been able to, so has my husband, and I think it's unfair that we've been denied our vote. ""We've lost our right to vote and the system has let us down."" Teignbridge District Council posted a message on Facebook, which said it was ""receiving a high number of calls"" from people who had not received their postal ballot. It said the ballots ""were issued to the Post Office first class on Friday 21 June"". The Post Office said Royal Mail was responsible for all deliveries. A Royal Mail spokesperson said it worked closely with local authorities on elections deliveries ""to ensure everything runs as smoothly as possible"". It said: We have investigated concerns with the delivery of postal votes in Devon and Cornwall and found one isolated incidence of delay but no wider issues. ""This delay is being rectified and postal votes are continuing to be delivered as ordered. The council asked anyone who had not received their voting pack to get in touch about collecting a replacement ballot.

Angling group fishes out stolen moped from river,"But it is not clear yet if it has been returned to its owner. The association said bailiffs gave up their personal angling time to keep the rivers safe and patrol them. Over the years, the team has recovered several unusual, items including a reportedly stolen handbag containing bank cards. Recently, the team cleared out a number of trolleys, bikes and scrap metal from the River Welland. Chairman Rob Harris said the organisation had seen the condition of rivers deteriorate over the years and has blamed pollution and fly-tipping. They [bailiffs] are a great deterrent to any anti-social behaviour alongside rivers and keep people in check and report any suspicious activity to police. They give up their own time to help out the angling community.

Another council sets up emergency postal vote centre,"The UK deadline to apply for postal vote applications was 19 June Any long-term postal voters or those who applied before 7 June should have received their voting pack last week. But many people were unaware that if they applied after 7 June, their voting papers would be sent out in a second tranche, with some only despatched in recent days. In Scotland, where the school term ends earlier than elsewhere in the UK, some voters had left the country for summer holidays before their postal ballots arrived. For those still in the country and without a voting pack,  replacement packs can be obtained from council offices early next week. If voters are concerned about posting dates for returning them, many councils have arrangements for handing them in at council offices, or they can be handed in by voters in person on polling day itself at their local polling station. But for anyone already out of the country there is little that can be done, barring a return home to vote. The deadline for proxy votes has passed and emergency proxy votes are only possible in limited circumstances such as being called away suddenly for work. The Electoral Management Board for Scotland (EMB), which co-ordinates and supports the work of returning officers and other council officials, said there had been ""many difficulties"" with the delivery of postal votes. Royal Mail said it had investigated concerns over the delivery of postal votes in some areas but had found no backlogs in any of its offices in Scotland. The EMB believes there should be  a ""major review of capacity and systems"" after the 4 July general election. EMB secretary Chris Highcock said deadlines were always tight but the timing of this election when many Scottish voters take their holidays was a complicating factor. He told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 that all materials had to be prepared in secure printing facilities. ""The timetable is such that we're only able to prepare ballot papers once we know who's going to be on the ballot paper for UK elections,""  he said. ""We're doing all we can to ensure that every voter that's entitled to vote in this election is able to take part."" Mr Highcock, who is also returning officer in Edinburgh, added: ""In Scotland, 20% of all voters are now postal voters - that has grown significantly in the last few years."" For those who plan to vote at polling places on Thursday, they open at 07:00 and will remain open until 22:00."
Appeal to find owner of stolen MBE medal,"An MBE is an order of the British Empire award. It is the third highest ranking Order of the British Empire award, behind CBE which is first and then OBE. It stands for Member of the Order of the British Empire, This one was awarded by King George V and police believe that it was something that may have been passed down through a family generation. But after failing to locate where and when the MBE award was stolen from, the force said it was now turning to the public for help to hopefully find the owner of the ""prestigious"" award. ""We have tried to reach out to potential owners and also spoke with St James Palace, but we have so far been unable to identify the owner,"" PC Welch added. It is a prestigious award, and so we would like to reunite it with the respective owner."" The offender who gave it to police was part of taking part in a scheme that sees stolen property returned while they undergo an intensive community sentence, the force said.

"Approval for 800 new homes, but few are affordable","More than 800 new homes are set to be built on the outskirts of a Cheshire town. Cheshire East Council has given the go-ahead for the plans, approving three separate housing applications for land off Minshull New Road and Flowers Lane near Leighton Hospital in Crewe. The authority also approved a fourth application for amenities such as cycle paths, play areas, open space, allotments and a community orchard. Despite passing the plans, councillors raised concerns about the lack of affordable housing included in the proposals. The site is included in the local plan and outline approval had already been granted for an overall scheme, which will also feature local shops, community facilities, a pub and a new primary school. The schemes approved this week will see 304 homes on two parcels of land which make up the southernmost part of the site. A further 304 homes will be built across five other parcels of land, and 200 on the last part, which makes up the northernmost part of the site. Although the four applications were dealt with separately, councillors said it was impossible to discuss one application without referring to the whole site. They raised concerns about flooding, how the work would be phased and the fact the developers, Bloor and Vistry, were only offering to make 10% of the homes affordable. Council planning officer Adrian Crowther admitted drainage had been a very significant issue on the site and said there had been discussions about how to resolve the issue. The committee was told the developers were only providing 10% affordable housing to make the scheme viable, as they were also building some of the road network. There was also an agreement that the school had to be built once half the homes were completed, they were told. Councillor Janet Clowes expressed frustration at the lack of affordable housing provision. A site this size with only 10% affordable housing in a place like Crewe, I think is absolutely appalling, she said. Councillor Ken Edwards added that the councils aspiration was for three times as many affordable homes as were being provided here. When I hear about viability, Im a little bit concerned, he said, citing that the developers were not building all of the roads proposed in the scheme. All four applications were approved unanimously, subject to conditions and an informative about liaison with local councillors about the phasing of the overall development.

Ards and North Down: Booking needed to use recycling centres,"Some recycling centres in Northern Ireland operated similar booking systems during the Covid-19 pandemic. But Ards and North Down is the first council to introduce it at all sites, on a permanent basis. Bookings can be made online or by telephone, up to 30 minutes before an allocated time. The council believes that by managing access there will be a reduction in queues at busy times, and an overall increase in recycling. Some residents have complained that the booking system will deter users and lead to an increase in fly-tipping. The council has said there is no evidence of this in parts of Great Britain, which already operate a similar scheme. The new system is operating at recycling centres in Bangor, Holywood, Newtownards, Donaghadee, Ballygowan, Kircubbin, Millisle, Portaferry and Comber. Access is restricted to householders in the council area, and personal details are checked before entry. To book a slot online, residents must provide: BBC News correspondent Mark Simpson The new system began operating on Monday at 08:00 BST, with no problems reported in the first few hours. Council staff were not rigorously enforcing the new rules as there is a two-week adjustment period for the scheme. Residents who turned up late for their allocated slot were still being allowed into recycling centres. The biggest test will come at the weekend when centres are normally at their busiest. A spokesperson for Ards and North Down Council said the move would help it achieve its environmental objectives and would increase recycling rates. The council aims to have a recycling rate of 70% by 2030. The spokesperson also said the move would ""significantly reduce the cost"" of disposing of waste by stopping commercial companies and people from outside the council area from using the centres. In the other 10 council areas in Northern Ireland, each has their own arrangements: More details of the specific arrangements are on the council websites.

Are we in a summer Covid wave?,"Possibly, but it is difficult to tell. We do know there has been a very small increase in the number of people being admitted to hospital with Covid. The number went up to 3.31 admissions per 100,000 in the week to 16 June, compared with 2.67 per 100,000 in the previous week. The largest group of people hospitalised with Covid were those aged 85 and over. In terms of how many people have Covid and stay at home, it is difficult to say. We no longer collect national data in the way we used to, as far less testing takes place now. That means many cases of Covid are not being recorded. The data we do have is based on laboratory tests taken across the country, mostly swabs taken from people in the healthcare system. According to this data, about one in every 25,000 people had Covid on 26 June. This may sound a lot but it is a tiny number compared with what we saw at the start of the pandemic. In March 2020, it was one in 13. However, rates of Covid go up and down throughout the year, without necessarily becoming a cause for concern. Prof Paul Hunter, an epidemiology expert from the University of East Anglia, told the BBC he did not believe the current Covid rates were concerning. I think we're probably seeing about as much infection this year as we were seeing last year - a little bit less, but not hugely less. He believes that generally, we are seeing far fewer deaths and far fewer hospitalisations from Covid than last year. In recent months, we have seen a new group of variants of Covid emerge, collectively nicknamed as FLiRT. Among them is the dominant JN1 variant and the KP2 variant. They account for many current Covid cases in England. The KP3 variant, which has driven a rise in cases in the US, has also been identified in the UK in small numbers. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said it needed more data on the new variants to understand how severe and transmissible they might be. The agency, which is responsible for public health, also said it was impossible to tell at this stage whether these variants were behind the small rise in hospital admissions. As it does with all new strains, the UKHSA said it would continue to monitor these variants in the UK and internationally and would gather more information on how well the vaccines protect people against them. But the agency said there was no current change to public health advice. It is normal for a virus to change and mutate and the UKHSA says the healthcare system is still getting to grips with the ebb and flow of cases. Prof Hunter said Covid was now part of life and should not be as alarming as it once was. He said: We are all of us going to get repeated Covid infections from births through to death. ""Generally what we've seen is that over the last three years, four years, the severity of illness associated with Covid has gone down a lot. ""Ultimately, it's going to become another cause of the common cold and, for many people, that's what it is now."" He added: To be honest, you can't really avoid it because it's so common. The official list of Covid symptoms has not changed, according to the UKHSA. General symptoms can include: There are no longer any legal restrictions requiring people to self-isolate if they have Covid. You also do not need to take a lateral flow test and there is no requirement to wear masks. However, government advice is to try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for five days after testing positive. People should also avoid meeting people who are more likely to fall seriously ill if they were to catch Covid, such as elderly people or those with weakened immune systems. If you are showing symptoms of Covid-19 or flu, help protect others by staying at home and avoiding contact with other people, especially those who are more vulnerable, the UKHSAs consultant epidemiologist Dr Jamie Lopez Bernal said. The vaccine programme has been scaled back since the initial rollouts early in the pandemic. Now, only certain people are entitled to jabs under seasonal booster programmes. They are: Vaccines are good at preventing severe Covid symptoms but they do not necessarily stop you becoming infected. NHS England previously urged anyone who was eligible for the jab to get vaccinated before the spring booster programme ended on Sunday, 30 June. The latest data showed four million people - 59.6% of those eligible - had been vaccinated under the scheme since April, including two-thirds of care home residents. Vaccinations are also available privately to anyone who can afford to pay for them. There is some talk of a ""summer Covid wave"" at the moment. We all seem to know someone who has had it lately, or a friend who has been off sick. But have cases really gone up and are there any new variants we should be worried about? What else do we know right now? Possibly, but it is difficult to tell. We do know there has been a very small increase in the number of people being admitted to hospital with Covid. The number went up to 3.31 admissions per 100,000 in the week to 16 June, compared with 2.67 per 100,000 in the previous week.

Mr Baxter said people travel from as far away as Australia and New Zealand to attend the annual show. David Crossland, 65, served with the Royal Corps of Signals. He said: I think its great, people [were] coming up to you to shake your hand for what youve done, the sacrifice youve made. Its a good atmosphere. Oliver, 10, who enjoyed inspecting some World War Two-era weaponry, said he thought the armed forces deserve respect for what they do for our country. Mark Fisher, who travelled to the event with his wife, said: ""Its an acknowledgement of people in the armed forces. It shows public support for the armed forces which I think can only be good. The event continues on Sunday at 10:00 BST and will include a large air display, markets and community activities across the seafront.

Asda and Tesco face legal action over E. coli cases,"Lawyers acting on behalf of two people who fell ill in an E. coli outbreak in the UK have started legal action against two leading supermarkets. Law firm Fieldfisher said on Friday it had issued letters of claim for breach of the Consumer Protection Act over own-brand sandwiches purchased in Tesco and Asda. The claims for compensation relate to a man from the South East and an 11-year-old girl in the North West. One person in England has died linked to the ongoing E. coli outbreak, the UK Health Security Agency said on Thursday, although they had underlying health conditions. The E. coli outbreak is thought to be caused by some supermarket sandwiches containing salad leaves. The large majority of cases reported so far developed symptoms before 4 June and the number of cases being reported is now falling, offering hope the outbreak may have ended. Several food manufacturers recalled some of their products as a precaution. The Food Standards Agency said lettuce is the likely source, based on tests. Fieldfisher said the claim against Asda related to a young girl who contracted E. coli after eating an own-brand chicken salad sandwich from the supermarket. ""The girl, aged 11, developed the serious condition haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), which attacks the kidneys and has been on dialysis for three weeks,"" it said. ""She was discharged home two days ago but could be at risk of permanent kidney damage. Her mother bought three of the sandwiches as part of an online delivery."" An Asda spokesman said that it had not yet received any letter from Fieldfisher regarding these claims, but added: ""As soon as we do we will review the details of the claim as a matter of urgency."" Harvinder Kaur, a director at Fieldfisher, told the PA News agency earlier on Friday that she had issued a separate letter to Tesco on behalf of a man from the South East. He was also hospitalised with E. coli symptoms after eating Tesco-branded sandwiches containing salad, the law firm claims. ""Luckily, this client did not go on to develop HUS and is now home, but for a time he was seriously ill,"" she said. ""Under the Act, companies producing food must ensure it is safe to eat. ""If it causes illness, it is a breach of their duty and those injured are eligible to claim compensation, not least to fund possible ongoing medical care."" She added that the man was a ""regular shopper"" at Tesco, buying his lunch there most weekdays as it was very close to his work. The BBC understands Tesco has yet to receive the letter from Fieldfisher. E. coli are a diverse group of bacteria that normally live in human and animal intestines. Some types are harmless but others can make people seriously ill. Tests have shown that the type in this outbreak is called E.coli STEC O145. It produces a Shiga toxin - which can attack the lining of the gut. Symptoms can include diarrhoea that can be bloody, stomach cramps, fever and vomiting. It usually takes a few days from being infected for symptoms to show. Most people recover well, but some - such as young children or people with underlying health conditions - can become very unwell. There is no specific treatment for E. coli infections. People who are infected can usually be cared for at home and most will get better without medical treatment. It is important to drink plenty of fluids, as diarrhoea can lead to dehydration. A small number may go on to develop a serious complications including HUS. People should seek medical help if worried - and there are things people can do to reduce the risk of infection. These include regularly wash your hands with warm water and soap - alcohol gels do not kill all bugs that cause diarrhoeal illness - and washing fruit and vegetables. It is also suggested to cook food to the temperatures on any packaging."
Asylum seekers lobby council for free bus travel,"The asylum seeker, who lives on the outskirts of Oxford, said: When I go outside I spend a lot of money on transport  two pounds to go and two pounds to come back. Because I am disabled I cant walk too much. I want them to give us free buses because we are here to make Oxford better.

Two refugees told an Oxfordshire County Council meeting their ""eight pounds a week"" government allowance was not enough to allow them to travel to activities including voluntary work.

Attempt to fly open basket-balloon across Atlantic abandoned,"She added: ""It was a very difficult decision and they are obviously extremely disappointed but safety is obviously paramount."" The attempt by the Torabhaig Atlantic Explorer crew was being monitored by Flight Control in Bristol. The spokeswoman said that the conditions had required an altitude higher than planned, and that would have needed ""increased ballast consumption"". The crew therefore decided to land the balloon having decided they would not have had enough ballast to make it to Europe. Prior to the attempt, Sir David said: ""At 67, I'm still young enough to take on a daring hydrogen balloon flight across the Atlantic. ""Age is just a number and the spirit of exploration never fades."" Sir David has already crossed the Atlantic twice in an open-basket balloon, but this was the first attempt at crossing the Atlantic ocean using a hydrogen balloon. He was accompanied by American balloon manufacturer Bert Padelt and Swedish explorer, scientist and entrepreneur Dr Frederik Paulsen. The attempt was also postponed last year due to bad weather. Sir David had said: ""My previous two Atlantic flights have been solo and my companions for this trip have no idea how loudly I snore. ""May the weather be with us this time as everything else is planned for and ready."" The highest level the team flew was at 10,000 ft (2,048 metres) and about 125 nautical miles in distance. They intended to conduct experiments during the journey, with one study aiming to find out how particles from forest fires travel through the atmosphere affecting conditions such as asthma. Clive Bailey, from Bailey Balloons, was at the Bristol base monitoring progress. He said: ""An amazing amount of work took place for over eight hours preparing the balloon for launch, with a tanker used to fill the balloon with hydrogen, while the team sorted all the technical equipment. ""The Flight Control Team have been up all night ensuring the safety of the balloon and crew while tracking progress."" Follow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

BT call centre to cut 300 staff from Enniskillen site,"About 300 people were employed at the County Fermanagh site providing support to EE mobile phone customers. They had previously been offered voluntary redundancy as the future of the site was reviewed. In a statement on Tuesday, Deirdre Hargey branded the company's decision to close by October 2024 as ""extremely disappointing"". ""As a major employer in the region for over three decades, this decision is devastating for the workers and their families, and also for the wider community,"" she said. She said she has asked Invest NI to ensure that ""every step possible"" is taken to support staff who have been affected by the decision. DUP MLA for Fermanagh and South Tyrone Deborah Erskine said the decision would be ""complete devastation to Enniskillen and the local economy"". ""What we are pursuing in the assembly is regional balance in terms of investment and in terms of jobs, and that was the vision that the economy minister set out,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""I will be very much holding the feet to the fire of the interim economy minister in relation to that vision to ensure that we have our fair share, in Fermanagh and South Tyrone, of investment and jobs."" In a statement, a BT spokesperson said that 252 out of 307 workers had applied for voluntary redundancy. ""We recently closed our voluntary paid leavers offer for colleagues, and over 80% of colleagues have taken the opportunity to take this up,"" the spokesperson said. ""We have now made the difficult decision to propose closing the site to the small number of remaining desk-based colleagues on 31 October and have entered into consultation with colleagues and trade union partners."" The Communication Workers Union (CWU) NI Telecoms Branch said they were ""totally devastated at the news"". ""This will have a major impact on these workers, their families and the local economy of Enniskillen town and surrounding areas of Fermanagh"", the regional secretary Erin Massey said."
BT fined thousands over unsafe work,"The local authority said it took action after discovering the sub-contractors did not have the appropriate permits and had breached the safety regulations. It said they did not give notice of the work starting, failed to put up adequate signs and guards, and did not put up a site information board. The council also said they failed to make the site safe when instructed and did not notify the council of work being completed in the timescale required. Following the case Openreach, which is wholly owned by BT, said health and safety was its ""number one priority"" and that its own staff were ""trained to a very high standard"". It said its partners did not meet those standards and added: ""In any situation like this, we review what went wrong and look to learn lessons  including providing additional training and support where thats needed. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Baldwin loses last-ditch bid to dismiss manslaughter case,"Josh Bash, an attorney for the actor, argued that this testing deprived the defence of a full opportunity to examine the gun in its original condition. This is among the most egregious constellation of facts Ive ever seen, Mr Bash said at a virtual hearing on Monday. They knew it would be destroyed, and they did nothing to preserve the evidence for the defendant."" ""It's outrageous and it requires dismissal,"" he added. But prosecutors have said that Mr Baldwin's team still has plenty of evidence for a defence, even without the weapon still intact, as all parts of the gun are still available. ""A review of the evidence in this case leads one to conclude that the exculpatory value of this firearm... is extremely low,"" special prosecutor Erlinda Johnson said in the hearing. Ms Johnson went on to quote an interview that the actor did with investigators from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), saying: ""Baldwin himself told OSHA investigators that the gun had no mechanical defects."" The defence asked that if the judge declined to throw out the case, she should at least not allow any of the technical gun analysis to be presented at trial. Shes previously denied other motions to dismiss his involuntary manslaughter charge. Mr Baldwin was originally charged with involuntary manslaughter, but had the charges dropped after the local district attorneys case fell apart. Local prosecutors said they had gathered additional facts from forensic tests on weapons, and Mr Baldwin was then recharged with a fresh count of involuntary manslaughter in January by a grand jury in New Mexico. Along with the criminal case, Mr Baldwin is also facing several civil lawsuits, including one brought by Ms Hutchins family. In a negligence legal action, they claim the cinematographer's death was caused by reckless behaviour. The fact that live ammunition was allowed on a movie set, that guns and ammunition were left unattended and that defendant Baldwin inexplicably pointed and fired a gun at Halyna Hutchins, makes this a case where injury or death was much more than just a possibility  it was a likely result, the lawsuit reads. In May, Mr Baldwin and his wife Hilaria announced that they and their seven children would star in their own reality show next year.

Mr Baldwin has not been present in any pretrial hearings, but is scheduled to be in court for the trial next month. A judge has denied a last-ditch effort by Alec Baldwin to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter charge against him over the fatal shooting of Halyna Hutchins, 42, on the set of his film Rust. The move comes two weeks before the actor is set to stand trial in New Mexico for the 2021 shooting that left the cinematographer dead. New Mexico District Court Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer denied 66-year-old Mr Baldwin's bid to have the charge dismissed, saying it must be resolved at trial. The proceedings are due to begin on 9 July with jury selection. The Emmy award-winning actor was holding a prop gun that fired during a scene rehearsal on set in Bonanza City, New Mexico, on 21 October 2021 killing Ms Hutchins and injuring director Joel Souza. The film's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, was sentenced to 18 months in prison in April after being found guilty on the same involuntary manslaughter charge faced by Mr Baldwin. In a five-page order released Friday, the judge wrote that ""whether the defendant [Baldwin] had a criminally negligent state of mind is a question of fact for the jury to decide"" in a trial. Over the last two and a half years, Mr Baldwin has maintained he did not pull the trigger and does not know how live ammunition ended up in the prop gun on the set of the Western. Mr Baldwins lawyers argued that since the most critical evidence in the case - the firearm - was destroyed the actor should be exonerated. In 2022, an FBI examiner took a mallet to the weapon as part of an accidental discharge test for their forensic analysis. The test broke internal components of the gun, prohibiting it from staying in the fully cocked position. Josh Bash, an attorney for the actor, argued that this testing deprived the defence of a full opportunity to examine the gun in its original condition. This is among the most egregious constellation of facts Ive ever seen, Mr Bash said at a virtual hearing on Monday. They knew it would be destroyed, and they did nothing to preserve the evidence for the defendant.""

Ban for music teacher who touched pupils' legs,"The hearing, which took place on 10 June, was told one of the pupils said Mr Hoyle had ""placed his hand on her thigh"" and ""squeezed her leg"". She said he had ""touched her leg two or three times in one-to-one music lessons"" and that this had happened after she had stopped sharing lessons with another pupil. Giving evidence in interviews before the hearing, Mr Hoyle denied the incident had happened. However, the panel said it found his answers to questions ""vague and contradictory"". It concluded his denial he had ""never touched"" the girl was at odds with his admission he regularly ""incidentally"" touched pupils during the course of his teaching, either when putting up music stands or to help them make adjustments with their instruments.

Banking hub to open in town with no branches,"Customers can use the kiosk to manage their money, with staff from the building society available to help.

Battle heats up for Norwich North constituency,"Norwich North has been held by the Conservatives for 15 years - but what will happen in this election? Former cabinet minister Chloe Smith first won the seat in 2009 but, almost two years ago, she announced that she would stand down at the next election. It took almost a year for the Conservatives to announce its proposed parliamentary candidate, but he was forced to step down shortly after. It is a target seat for Labour, who have campaigned heavily in the area, with the Green Party, Liberal Democrats, Reform UK and an independent candidate also standing. Norwich North includes areas such as Mile Cross, Old Catton and Hellesdon, as well as Norwich International Airport. Its boundaries have changed since the last election, with Drayton moved from Broadland back into the constituency. Election candidates, listed in alphabetical order by their last name, have been talking about their priorities. Liberal Democrat Chika Akinwale said that improving access to health services was a key issue for her. She said people in Norwich North found trying to get an NHS appointment with a dentist almost impossible, while many faced long waits to see a GP. Ms Akinwale, who is a district councillor in Ely, also said that education was the best possible investment our country can make and she wanted improved provision for children with special educational needs. If elected, I would champion the Liberal Democrats' plan to ensure every child get the much-needed support they deserve, she added. Alice MacDonald, from Labour, said her party would provide 700,000 extra urgent dental appointments and 40,000 additional NHS appointments nationally. She backed the idea of a new dental school being opened at the University of East Anglia. ""If weve got people training here, they are more likely to stay here and provide the services that we need,"" she said. Ms MacDonald, who previously worked in the charity sector, said she had grown up in west Norfolk before making her home in the constituency. She said there was a shortage of affordable homes and wanted councils to have more house building powers, pointing to Norwich City Councils Goldsmith Street development as an example of what could be done. The Green Partys Ben Price said brownfield sites in Norwich could be redeveloped into good, affordable, social low-carbon housing. The white elephant in the room is Anglia Square, which is an absolute opportunity that has been continually undersold by the Labour council, he added. Mr Price, who is a councillor in Norwich, said he had lived in the city for a long time and would be a local voice for constituents. He also said he wanted to see better funding for the NHS and more work done to attract low-carbon jobs to the city. Charlotte Salomon, from the Conservatives, said that getting [NHS] waiting lists down was a priority for her and she also backed the idea of a local dentistry school. Its quite a commitment for people to move to Norwich so I think the best thing we can do is train and retain people in Norwich, she said. Ms Salomon described herself as a normal person with small children, who could bring a fresh on the ground perspective to parliament. She said her partys plan to bring back the Help to Buy scheme would help people get on to the housing ladder, while people wanted to know more about the Conservatives' proposals to curb both legal and illegal migration. Reform UK candidate Nick Taylor said his campaign was mainly based on national issues, but added that some of those feed into whats going on locally as well. He said that he wanted to see more police on the streets and warned of daylight muggings and drug dealing along with an epidemic of shoplifting. Mr Taylor said that he had lived in Norwich for 21 years, ran his own business and had a rich life experience. He said an increasing population was putting too much pressure on housing and that Reforms plan to raise the basic rate tax threshold would disproportionately benefit the lower paid. nan Independent candidate Fiona Grace is also standing in the constituency.

Battles rage in north Gaza as Palestinian fighters ambush Israeli troops,"Palestinian fighters engaged Israeli forces in fierce battles in northern Gaza Cityâs Shujayea neighbourhood a day after tanks and troops rolled in and sent tens of thousands of terrified civilians fleeing. In a statement on Friday, al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, said it blew up a booby-trapped residential building in Shujayea, killing four Israeli soldiers and wounding five others. The improvised explosive device used was an undetonated F-16 missile recovered intact after it was fired from an Israeli warplane, it said. The Qassam Brigades, Hamasâs armed wing, said its fighters also continue to engage in âviolent clashesâ while âinflicting deaths and injuriesâ in attacks with anti-tank rockets and small-arms fire. A day earlier, Israeli forces carried out heavy air and artillery attacks and sent armoured vehicles into war-ravaged northern Gaza in a renewed assault after pulling out in January saying Hamas had been âdismantledâ in the area. Palestinian civilians are leaving on foot carrying their meagre belongings through rubble-strewn streets in the intense summer heat. Israel displaced at least 60,000 people from Gaza City since Thursday, UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said on Friday. No official confirmation of soldiersâ deaths Shujayea was immediately available on Friday but Israelâs military did report one soldier was killed and nine were wounded in clashes throughout Gaza over the last 24 hours. nan nan Ground operations backed by air raids are continuing in northern Gaza, killing âdozensâ of fighters, the army said on Friday. The heavy fighting follows comments by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week suggesting the âintense phaseâ of the war is winding down. Soldiers âstarted to conduct targeted raidsâ in Shujayea as intelligence indicated âthe presence of terrorists and terrorist infrastructure in the area â, the military said, in its first details of the operation. At least 668 Israeli soldiers have been killed since October 7, 2023, including more than 300 since the ground invasion of Gaza began. Another 3,953 have been wounded. Israel says it killed about 15,000 Palestinian fighters during the nearly nine-month conflict. Israel lost eight soldiers in a single attack earlier this month in southern Rafah as Hamas fighters ambushed and blew up a military vehicle with a rocket-propelled grenade. Palestinian health officials said tank shelling in Rafah killed at least 11 people on Friday. Displaced Palestinian families fled what they said was intensifying Israeli fire to seek shelter further north, describing chaotic scenes as fighting drew closer. One resident said some bulldozers in the Shakoush area piled up sand for Israeli tanks to station behind. âThe situation there is very dangerous and many families are leaving towards Khan Younis, even from the Mawasi area as things became unsafe for them,â the unnamed man told the Reuters news agency. The UNâs Dujarric said incursions into al-Mawasi â declared an âevacuation zoneâ by Israelâs army â resulted in many casualties and displacement of at least 5,000 people. Most of Gazaâs population has been uprooted and much of the territoryâs infrastructure destroyed, leaving residents struggling to survive. A UN-backed assessment this week said nearly 500,000 people in Gaza are experiencing âcatastrophicâ hunger. nan nan"

Beckford's Tower reopens after £3.9m refurb,"Dr Frost said: The creation of Beckfords Tower and the collection within it was all underpinned by the exploitation and suffering of thousands of enslaved people. It has been vital that we work with others to tell this story as openly and accurately as possible."" The new museum will have displays showcasing pieces from Beckford's varied collections, including furniture, cutlery and fine art. The project also aims to bring the story of Beckford's ""complex and controversial"" life to a wider audience. His wealth came from his ownership of sugar plantations in Jamaica and the transatlantic trafficking of enslaved people. ""It's a very complex story,"" added Dr Frost. ""William Beckford built beautiful buildings, created a beautiful collection. ""But there is a brutality behind all of that beauty because all of the funds that paid for it came from the transatlantic trafficking of enslaved African people. ""And that's fundamental to the story that we tell at the museum."" The new exhibition spaces will explore the themes of wealth and power, exploitation and abuse. Patrizia Ribul, the director of museums at Bath Preservation Trust, said the newly excavated grotto will redefine peoples experience while touring the destination. The grotto in particular forms a really intriguing part of the visitor experience, expanding the visitor route far beyond the previous climb up the tower. People will be able to book behind-the-scenes tours up the architecturally iconic staircase to the tiny golden lantern at the top of the tower, with extraordinary views over Bath, she added. The refurbishment included making a step-free accessible space in the towers vault, conservation works to remove the building from the Heritage At Risk register, restoration of lost design elements and building the tower's connection to its wider landscape with footpaths. Ms Ribul went on to thank the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Historic England, Bath Preservation Fund and group funders for financing the restoration. The tower will be open on weekends and bank holiday Mondays from 29 June to 31 October, before switching to weekends only from 1 November. Follow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

The refurbishment of Beckfords Tower in Bath was originally just for essential repair works but it was extended to reimagine the museum and excavate a hidden grotto, that had been underground for more than 100 years. Senior curator at Bath Preservation Trust, Dr Amy Frost said it was important to clearly explain William Beckford's connection to the slave trade. The project, which has also seen new energy sources installed, was funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund among others.

Beloved toyshop saved by owner's daughter,"""My dad was very keen for someone to take over,"" she told the Radio Wales Phone-In on Friday. ""He'd always say to me and my husband, 'the shops there for you', but I knew how hard he worked, and that sort of employment wasnt going to be an option for us."" Ms James's decision came after a tough period. ""My husband lost his dad in January, we both were made redundant, and two days after I finished my work, my dad passed away,"" she said. ""It was as if everything aligned to bring us back to Aberystwyth."" But she had her doubts about relocating from Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan, back to her home town. ""Aberystwyth is a wonderful place, I just wasnt sure that 45 years after growing up in the shop, that this was where we were going to be,"" she said. ""But the people of Aberystwyth are just so wonderful, there has been just so much support. Its a really difficult time when your parents pass away and Ive just been really supported by everybody."" Mr Morgan, or Dai as he was known best, bought the shop when Ms James was seven years old, and she fondly remembers the community bustle that made it a central part of Aberystwyth. She said she had an outpouring of support from the community after her father's death. ""I love hearing peoples stories about their memories of my mum and dad in the shop, and my dad being on the doorstep always chatting to people,"" she said. ""I've felt that the shop was more than just a toy and model shop, it was about that community hub. Its just been really, so comforting hearing peoples stories."" The shop, which will reopen on 1 July, is known for its old-fashioned feel with boxes full of trains, planes and cars piled up from floor to ceiling. Despite the overwhelming inventory, Mr Morgan had a knack for knowing exactly where everything was. Ms James said she hoped to carry on her father's legacy, but said it would take time to become as adept as he was: ""Its an Aladdins cave, it is stuffed jam packed full of goodies, models, planes trains."""
Bereaved dad takes on hill and mountain challenge,"He said: ""We've been supported by a charity called 2Wish, and they are a Welsh-based charity that started operating in England on New Year's Day, as kind of fate would have it, I suppose. They supply immediate support to families that have suffered an unexpected loss of a child. So, we're raising money for them. ""They've been an absolute lifesaver for us and other people as well. Mr Curtis has been inviting people to join him on the walks, via a Facebook page. More than 35 people, including friends, family and his two dogs, have joined in at various points. There's a lot of different mixture of ages and abilities on the walks as well. So, it's really good for people to get to know each other, Mr Curtis said. Mr Curtis is originally from Cornwall, where he completed his first walk in May. That was followed by walking up hills in Devon, Gloucestershire, Somerset and Dorset before heading to Monmouthshire for his most recent walk. He is determined to complete a total of 82 walks by autumn 2025. Mr Curtis said he was grateful to have met other bereaved families through 2wish. He said: So 2Wish run regular coffee mornings, in and around Bristol, and in fact, everywhere they operate, where families can get together and talk about what they're going through. So, we've made some really good friends through that. And what is really noticeable is that everybody's situation is obviously slightly different. But there are very, very broad similarities as well, between what everybody's going through. Soon after Lucy died, 2Wish sent a support worker to the family. Mr Curtis said: She just came and sat with us. And she came every week for probably two months, two and a half months and would just sit with us, help us with anything practical, emotional, anything at all that she could support us with, is what they did. Mr Curtis said as time has passed, the family has been able to better cope with the loss. The Riverside Adolescent Unit was shut down after an internal review by Avon and Wiltshire Mental Health Partnership NHS Trust said it could not give assurance  the unit could deliver a safe level of care moving forward."
Bereaved families call for drug law change,"Ms Cockburn was one of the founding families of Anyone's Child, set up to give a voice to bereaved families calling for more regulation of drugs that are currently illegal. The families argue that if substances can be regulated by medical professionals instead of produced and sold without any checks by criminals, the number of drug-related deaths would be reduced. Jane Slater, campaign manager for Anyone's Child said: ""Here in the UK we have the worst drug-death rates in Europe and every single death is someones child."" The gathering in Bristol was intended to ""demonstrate the scale of the problem and the urgent need for change,"" she added. ""I will just keep on doing this until things change - and they will change,"" said Ms Cockburn. Her daughter Martha died after taking MDMA (ecstasy) which was later found to be 91% pure, a fact she wasn't aware of at the time. Ms Cockburn said she ""didn't know anything"" about drug policy before Martha's death but that the ordeal had led to her becoming a ""kind of mini expert"". ""When I realised just what wasn't being done I couldn't believe it, I was really shocked and actually quite fearful for other families when I realised how policy works,"" she said. ""You go to Westminster and you see how things function, but I was quite appalled actually by the lack of awareness from many MPs on this subject and how it impacts every community in the UK. ""I just think that if you legally regulate [drugs] you're going to change the shape of society in every way, in such a beneficial way, but most people don't realise that.""

Thousands of homemade flowers have been left on a city centre green space this week by bereaved families calling for drug regulation. Each of the 4,305 paper flowers laid on College Green in Bristol on Tuesday represented a life lost to drugs in the UK. Organised by charities Transform Drug Policy Foundation and Anyone's Child, the event saw families share their stories publicly. Anne-Marie Cockburn, whose daughter Martha died in 2013 aged just 15 after taking MDMA, said: ""If you put the stories of the families next to any statistic then it brings to life the real harm and the true cost.""

Bergerac star urges government to buy war tunnels,"Mr Nettles said his ""gut instinct"" was the government had a ""duty"" to buy the tunnels. He said: ""Because the Jersey War Tunnels are such an important, central, indeed iconic part of Jersey history, therefore it should be the States' responsibility, indeed duty, to take over the place."" Mr Nettles said the tunnels told a story that should not be forgotten. ""It can still be a place which is entertaining in the sense that it is interesting, but also a museum to remember what happened not only in the war tunnels themselves, but also what happened to the civilian population over here during the war."" Daisy Hill Real Estates Limited (DHRE), which owned the tunnels for more than 60 years, said it was seeking a buyer which would ""propel JWT to the next level"". Minister for Sustainable Economic Development Kirsten Morel said the tunnels were a ""very well-established and successful visitor attraction which has been owned by the same company for the last 60 years"". Deputy Morel added: ""The owners have assured their staff and islanders that day-to-day operations will remain unchanged while they go through the sale process, and that thousands of visitors are expected in the coming months. ""I am confident that whoever purchases Jersey War Tunnels will ensure that this fantastic and important attraction continues to flourish. Follow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

Bid fails to grant M&S building listed status,"Historic England said it did not take the application forward because ""it did not meet the necessary criteria for listing in a national context"".

Biden assures donors he can still win election,"Biden campaign chairwoman Jennifer O'Malley Dillon said on Saturday, however, that internal post-debate polling showed ""voters' opinions were not changed"". ""It will not be the first time that overblown media narratives have driven temporary dips in the polls,"" she said. While the Biden campaign has acknowledged that the debate had not gone as they had hoped, it has maintained its stance that the president will not step aside for another nominee. Mr Biden has also said he understands the concerns, but pledged to fight harder. New Jersey's Democratic governor Phil Murphy attended the fundraiser in his state alongside Mr Biden and the First Lady - and told Mr Biden that ""we are all with you 1,000%"". Former President Barack Obama, who remains a popular figure in the Democratic party, said on social media that ""bad debate nights happen"". ""This election is still a choice between someone who fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself,"" Mr Obama wrote. Hours after the debate, Mr Trump told his supporters that he considered the debate a ""big victory"" for his campaign. ""Joe Biden's problem is not his age,"" the 78-year-old Trump said. ""It's his competence. He's grossly incompetent."" Mr Biden's performance was not only criticised by those in politics. A prominent editorial in the New York Times described his determination to run again as a ""reckless gamble"", and urged him to do some soul-searching this weekend. It said Democrats should ""acknowledge that Mr Biden cant continue his race, and create a process to select someone more capable to stand in his place"". Voters across the United States have also expressed concerns over voting for either candidate following Thursday's debate. Long-time Democrat Lori Gregory told the BBC that she ""could not handle"" watching the debate, and asked, ""is this the best our country can do?"" Republican Crystal Myers-Barber said it was ""painful to watch"", but added that she thought ""Trump came across very level-headed and presidential and Biden came across very weak."" Democrat Shana Ziolko said she was ""frustrated"" watching the debate, and thought there was no clear winner. A post-debate poll by liberal pollster Data for Progress found that 62% of likely voters who watched or read about the debate found Trump won. Only 30% of those polled said Mr Biden won the debate. Until further polling is conducted, fundraising could be another indication of continued enthusiasm for Mr Biden's candidacy. In a memo, chairwoman Jennifer O'Malley Dillon said the campaign had raised more than $27m (£21.3m) from the Thursday debate to Friday evening. ""Following Thursday nights debate, the beltway class is counting Joe Biden out. The data in the battleground states, though, tells a different story,"" she said. ""This election was incredibly close before Thursday, and by every metric weve seen since, it remains just as close"", she added. US President Joe Biden has assured Democrat donors that he can still win November's presidential election against Donald Trump, after a poor debate performance fuelled concern about his candidacy. The president, 81, attended a series of fundraising events in New York and New Jersey on Saturday, and defended his performance in CNN's Presidential Debate. Speaking at one event, Mr Biden admitted, ""I didnt have a great night, but neither did Trump on Thursday. ""I promise you we're going to win this election,"" he said. Mr Biden's debate performance was marked by hard-to-follow and shaky answers - raising fresh fears among some Democrats over whether he is the right candidate to contest this high-stakes election. Former Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi said Mr Biden's debate performance wasnt great - while his former communications director, Kate Bedingfield, called it really disappointing. Voters in the US have regularly shared doubts about Mr Biden's mental and cognitive health, and early polling after the debate shows the number who doubt his ability to serve as president has only grown. On 9 June, a CBS News poll found that 65% of registered voters said that the president does not have the mental fitness to serve as president. The network released a new poll on Sunday that showed that number had jumped to 72% after his poor debate performance. Biden campaign chairwoman Jennifer O'Malley Dillon said on Saturday, however, that internal post-debate polling showed ""voters' opinions were not changed"". ""It will not be the first time that overblown media narratives have driven temporary dips in the polls,"" she said. While the Biden campaign has acknowledged that the debate had not gone as they had hoped, it has maintained its stance that the president will not step aside for another nominee. Mr Biden has also said he understands the concerns, but pledged to fight harder. New Jersey's Democratic governor Phil Murphy attended the fundraiser in his state alongside Mr Biden and the First Lady - and told Mr Biden that ""we are all with you 1,000%"". Former President Barack Obama, who remains a popular figure in the Democratic party, said on social media that ""bad debate nights happen"". ""This election is still a choice between someone who fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself,"" Mr Obama wrote. Hours after the debate, Mr Trump told his supporters that he considered the debate a ""big victory"" for his campaign. ""Joe Biden's problem is not his age,"" the 78-year-old Trump said. ""It's his competence. He's grossly incompetent."" Mr Biden's performance was not only criticised by those in politics. A prominent editorial in the New York Times described his determination to run again as a ""reckless gamble"", and urged him to do some soul-searching this weekend. It said Democrats should ""acknowledge that Mr Biden cant continue his race, and create a process to select someone more capable to stand in his place"". Voters across the United States have also expressed concerns over voting for either candidate following Thursday's debate. Long-time Democrat Lori Gregory told the BBC that she ""could not handle"" watching the debate, and asked, ""is this the best our country can do?"" Republican Crystal Myers-Barber said it was ""painful to watch"", but added that she thought ""Trump came across very level-headed and presidential and Biden came across very weak."" Democrat Shana Ziolko said she was ""frustrated"" watching the debate, and thought there was no clear winner. A post-debate poll by liberal pollster Data for Progress found that 62% of likely voters who watched or read about the debate found Trump won. Only 30% of those polled said Mr Biden won the debate. Until further polling is conducted, fundraising could be another indication of continued enthusiasm for Mr Biden's candidacy. In a memo, chairwoman Jennifer O'Malley Dillon said the campaign had raised more than $27m (£21.3m) from the Thursday debate to Friday evening. ""Following Thursday nights debate, the beltway class is counting Joe Biden out. The data in the battleground states, though, tells a different story,"" she said. ""This election was incredibly close before Thursday, and by every metric weve seen since, it remains just as close"", she added."
"Biden vows to fight on, rejecting calls to step aside","US President Joe Biden has hit back at criticism over his age, telling supporters in a fiery speech that he will win re-election in November after a poor debate performance fuelled concern about his candidacy. ""I know I'm not a young man, to state the obvious,"" he told a rally in the battleground state of North Carolina on Friday, one day after he struggled in the televised showdown with his Republican rival Donald Trump. ""I dont walk as easy as I used to...?I dont debate as well as I used to,"" he acknowledged. ""But I know what I do know, I know how to tell the truth?[and] I know how to do this job."" Mr Biden, 81, said he believed with his ""heart and soul"" that he could serve another term, as the cheering crowd in Raleigh chanted four more years. While questions over Mr Biden's age are not new, his shaky performance on the debate stage - which was marked by verbal blanks, a hoarse voice and some difficult-to-follow answers - triggered panic among some Democrats who raised fresh questions about his candidacy. Mr Biden's campaign has remained emphatic that the country's oldest presidential candidate is still fit to serve another term. Campaign officials said he would not step aside for another nominee, despite the poor performance. ""Absolutely not,"" Mia Ehrenberg, a Biden campaign spokesperson, said in response to questions about whether Mr Biden would vacate his candidacy. And while several campaign surrogates - including Vice President Kamala Harris - admitted in interviews that the president stumbled during the debate, they reiterated their commitment to the elder statesman and stressed that his answers were more substantive than Mr Trump's. The president might have lost the debate on style, but he won it on facts, he won it on decency, and he won it on the ideas people think are important in this country, campaign co-chair Mitch Landrieu said on CNN the morning after the debate. In the days since, many senior Democrats and Biden allies have made additional efforts to defend the former president's performance and calm liberal jitters. Former President Barack Obama, who remains one of the party's most popular figures, tweeted that ""bad debate nights happen"". ""This election is still a choice between someone who fought for ordinary folks his entire life and someone who only cares about himself,"" Mr Obama wrote, adding that Mr Trump is ""someone who lies through his teeth for his own benefit"". But Democratic fears about Mr Biden are far from quashed. Party officials, political operatives, and people close to the president who spoke to the BBC's Katty Kay painted a picture of an anxious party concerned about the strength of their candidate. Nancy Pelosi, the former Democratic House speaker, said that from a performance standpoint it wasnt great. Other Democrats, such as Bidens former communications director Kate Bedingfield, called it a really disappointing debate performance. Democratic donors who spoke anonymously to various media outlets were more forthright, with one calling the performance ""disqualifying"". ""The only way it could have been more disastrous was if he had fallen off the stage. Big donors are saying... he has to go, one Democratic operative told the Financial Times. And on Friday, the New York Times editorial board called on Mr Biden to drop out. It said Democrats should ""acknowledge that Mr Biden cant continue his race, and create a process to select someone more capable to stand in his place"". Mr Trump, meanwhile, held a rally of his own in Virginia just hours later, where he hailed a ""big victory"" in the debate, which CNN said was viewed by 48 million people on television and millions more online. ""Joe Biden's problem is not his age,"" the 78-year-old Trump said. ""It's his competence. He's grossly incompetent."" The former president said he did not believe speculation that Mr Biden would drop out of the race, saying he ""does better in polls"" than other Democrats, including California Governor Gavin Newsom and Vice-President Kamala Harris. Despite concern from some media pundits, early indications suggest there has been ""no change"" in the polls in the aftermath of the debate, the Washington Post columnist Philip Bump told BBC R4's Today programme. Speaking later on the programme, pollster Frank Luntz said there may not be a significant change to voters' intentions - as most Americans have already made up their minds about who they will vote for later this year. Early polls do show that American voters considered Mr Trump to be the clear winner, however. A post-debate poll by liberal pollster Data for Progress found that 62% of likely voters who watched or read about the debate found Trump won. Only 30% of those polled by the progressive polling group said Mr Biden won the debate. Until further polling is conducted, fundraising could be another indication of continued enthusiasm for Mr Biden's candidacy - a significant change on that front could pose a major challenge for Democrats. In an apparent effort to show it was maintaining momentum, the Biden campaign has said that the president raised $14m from fundraisers in recent days. And from the Thursday debate to Friday evening, it said Mr Biden had raised more than $27 million for the campaign. Mr Biden is also expected to meet with additional donors on Saturday.

Borough's public drinking ban set to be approved,"A plan to ban drinking alcohol in public across all of Slough is set to be approved. The public space protection order (PSPO) would prohibit consuming alcohol or having an open container that is ""reasonably believed"" to contain alcohol in public places. Slough Borough Council said 93% of all people who responded to a consultation about the plan earlier this year were in favour. The authoritys cabinet is set to approve the three-year order next Monday. A respondent to the consultation, which ran from 15 January to 12 February, said they had seen street drinkers urinate and defecate on the street in full view of [the] public. Not what I want to view or for my children to witness. Disgusting, they added. The authority said without a ban it is inevitable anti-social behaviour will continue. Slough previously had a PSPO banning public drinking between 2017 and 2020 but only in certain areas. The authority suggested that led to public drinkers moving to places where the ban was not in force. Anyone who breaks the new order could be issued with a £100 fine and convicted of a criminal offence if they do not pay it. It would also be an offence to not stop drinking alcohol or to refuse to hand alcohol over to police or authorised officers when asked. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

Bowel cancer charity challenge raises more than £17k,"The challenge began at 04:00 BST, and each workout throughout the day had a ""meaningful"" connection to Mr Butcher - relating to his age, family, or the past two-and-a-half-years since his diagnosis. The 45-year-old had ""zero symptoms"" before he was diagnosed with the disease in November 2021. Last June, he underwent a gruelling 15-hour operation to remove the cancerous cells in his body. The procedure is dubbed ""the mother of all surgeries"" by some medical professionals, due to how risky and invasive it is.

Boy in tears as Disney flight after chemo cancelled,"Ms Styles said: ""When we arrived at the airport a woman at check-in told us our flight was cancelled and asked us to move to the side."" She added when she told Charlie and his eight-year-old sister Maicie they would not be going abroad, they were both upset. ""They burst into tears, devastated. They couldnt understand why they couldnt go."" In 2023, Charlie completed 18 months of chemotherapy after being diagnosed with a brain tumour. Ms Styles described the period as ""rough time"" for the whole family who were looking forward to the trip to see Mickey Mouse in Paris. The family were particularly excited about a breakfast session where they would have met their favourite Disney characters. The situation was made worse by the Styles being one of only two families unable to catch replacement flights from Bristol and Gatwick. ""It was like breaking Charlies heart twice,"" Ms Styles said. ""First we were going, then we couldnt. Then we might be going after all, but then we couldnt again. ""So were home now with the kids fed up and saying 'we should be in Disney right now'."" Ms Styles added she had nothing but praise for the Make A Wish volunteers who did their best to enable them to find alternative flights. She said she has also been told her family were at ""the top of their priority"" for another trip. ""Make A Wish were doing what they could from the moment they found out about it."" she said. ""They told us at 6am that Easyjet customer services don't open until 8am but they are trying to sort it out. ""I think there were nine families and five got on a flight at alternative airports, either Gatwick or Bristol. EasyJet said it understood the family's disappointment.

Boy to finish Three Peaks to help military children,"""I love my dad a lot. When he goes away it's just so hard, I hate not seeing him and not spending time with him,"" he said.

Alex has raised £400 of his £450 target for the charity and said he hoped it would help them help children going through some of the same things he had experienced. ""When you donate to them, they can spend money making sure people are okay, and get them stuff like toys,"" he said. His father joined the RAF in 2005 and soon afterwards was sent to Afghanistan and was away from his family for up to five months each year. ""It's the family you worry about back at home who are going through their daily life but you're not there, I find that really tough,"" said Chris. ""When we heard about Alex's challenge, we just couldn't wait to shout from the rooftops about what an amazing military child he is, and what a humongous challenge this is in aid of our charity,"" said Louise Fetigan, founder of the charity.

Boy's Ben Nevis climb in memory of 'Everest idol',"A fundraising schoolboy is climbing the UK's highest mountain, Ben Nevis, in memory of his ""idol"" who is presumed dead after a fall on Everest. Eight-year-old William Knox followed Daniel Paterson's journey to summit the 29,032ft (8,849m) peak last month. The 39-year-old co-owner of a Wakefield gym and his local guide went missing after they were hit by falling ice as they descended Everest on 21 May. William, who has been climbing since the age of four, is taking on his latest challenge to raise money for his school, Wrenthorpe Academy, and Wakefield Hospice. The youngster has already raised more than £2,500 for the hospice by scaling numerous other mountains, including Snowden, Scafell Pike and the Old Man of Coniston. His mum Natalie, who is a member of Mr Paterson's gym, Wakefield Crossfit, said the pair had struck up a friendship over their love of climbing. ""When William climbed Snowden, Dan was really supportive and William came down to the gym to give out his sponsorship forms. ""Dan did a lovely speech at one of his classes about what William was doing and they got this little friendship going. ""So when Dan went to climb Everest, William followed his updates daily on Instagram and he'd come home every day and watch his videos. ""He's definitely William's idol, so it seemed fitting that he do his next climb in his memory."" William said some of the money raised from climbing the 4,413ft (1.3km) Scottish mountain on 14 August would go towards buying a trim trail for his school so him and his classmates could keep fit. The schoolboy, who has set up a JustGiving page for his challenge, said he loved climbing because it helped keep him healthy and strong. ""It makes me get more biceps and a six pack and also helps with my running."" His ultimate dream is to follow in Mr Paterson's footsteps and travel to Everest. Miss Knox, 43, said: ""He's pestered me since watching Dan's videos that he wants to do Everest base camp, but I've said not until he's 16, so we're saving up for that."" Asked how he would rise to his latest challenge, she added: ""Whenever he's feeling tired, he'll say 'Dan wouldn't give up' so he'll be determined. ""Dan has definitely planted a seed for William and hopefully he'll live on in William's memory."" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

The teenager was arrested on suspicion of possession of a bladed article and possession of a class B or C drug, and also on suspicion of attempted murder, in Chapel Road, Shoebury, on 19 May. District commander for Southend, Ch Insp Jo Collins, said: I would like to commend the actions of the off duty Metropolitan Police Officer, who ran towards an individual suspected of holding a knife in order to protect the safety of the wider public. This bravery is admirable and demonstrates the courage that police officers across the country show every day."" She said police would continue to investigate the Shoebury attack. Follow Essex news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story? Email eastofenglandnews@bbc.co.uk or WhatsApp us on 0800 169 1830"
Brain injury survivor volunteers at Glastonbury,"The charity has partnered with Glastonbury since 1994, supporting services on site while highlighting its work to help bring clean water and sanitation to people living in poverty around the world. While more than 200,000 festival goers will be partying at Pyramid Stage, Mr Blundell will be filling up water bottles at the WaterAid bars and kiosks across the site. Today, nearly one in ten people around the world dont have clean water close to home, and nearly one in five dont have a decent toilet of their own,"" Mr Blundell said. ""Glastonbury is a great opportunity to help raise awareness of a cause that I care deeply about. In April this year, Mr Blundell managed to complete the London Marathon for WaterAid after regaining movement in his right side. He noted that during the run, there was ""more than enough water"" supplied. ""We take it for granted so much, and I cant imagine what it would be like to live without such a basic thing,"" he said. ""Whether its going to a water kiosk to get a drink, or waiting to use a toilet, Glastonbury is the ideal setting for people to start to understand what it might be like for the millions of people who dont have access to clean water or decent toilets."" This year - marking 30 years of partnership - there will be more than 700 WaterAid volunteers at the UKs biggest outdoor music festival. Alongside working the water refill bars, they will be running the womens urinals, cleaning the toilets and handwashing stations, and supporting the post-festival clean-up.

British bank accused of helping to fund terrorists,"Standard Chartered was publicly accused of falsifying transaction data on Swift - an international payment system used by thousands of financial institutions - to move billions of dollars through its New York branch on behalf of sanctioned entities such as the Central Bank of Iran. But in September 2012, George Osborne, then chancellor in Lord Camerons government, secretly intervened on the banks behalf. Three months later, the US Department of Justice decided not to prosecute the bank. The foreign exchange transactions identified in the court filings were yet to come to light and it is not suggested that Mr Osborne or Lord Cameron had any knowledge of these transactions at the time. The bank has twice admitted breaching sanctions against Iran and other countries - first in 2012 and then in 2019 - paying fines totalling more than $1.7bn. But it has not admitted conducting transactions for terrorist organisations. The transactions lay hidden in confidential bank spreadsheets first handed to the US authorities in 2012 by two whistleblowers, including a former Standard Chartered executive, Julian Knight. They allege US government agencies made false statements to a court in order to have their claim for a whistleblowers reward dismissed. The US authorities involved in investigating the bank successfully applied to have their case dismissed in 2019. A FBI agent claimed to a court that it showed nothing that indicated or suggested that the bank had engaged in improper US dollar transactions after 2007. US authorities argued the whistleblowers allegations did not lead to the discovery of any new  violations and the court dismissed the case as meritless. However, independent analysis by an expert with decades of experience with counter-terrorist financing, including at the US Department of Defense (DoD) and in the private sector, David Scantling, contradicts that. In a court filing last Friday, he states that the spreadsheets contain records of more than half a million separate transactions between 2008 and 2013 that were cloaked, meaning they were not immediately visible in the spreadsheets but could be extracted through a simple technique well-known to analysts in his field. His declaration says that among the records are numerous transactions by Standard Chartered Bank (SCB), with or on behalf of Iranian banks, Iranian companies and Middle Eastern money exchanges that, according to [the US government], finance designated foreign terrorist organisations. He says SCB processed transactions for a bank fronting for the Central Bank of Iran after it claimed to have stopped its Iranian operations in 2007. That happened at the same time it was borrowing an average of $2bn a day from the Term Auction Facility, an emergency programme set up by the US government to support banks through the global financial crisis of 2007-2009. The newly extracted data simply cannot be reconciled with the governments representations to the court in this matter that the [whistleblowers evidence] contains no evidence of undisclosed sanctions violations, the Scantling declaration says. The transactions include those of a Pakistani fertiliser company, Fatima Fertiliser, known for selling explosive materials that were used by the Taliban in roadside bombs that killed or maimed thousands of UK and US military personnel in Afghanistan. SCB, the shirt sponsor for Liverpool FC, also facilitated 73 transactions for a Gambian front company owned by a key Hezbollah financier, Mohammad Ibrahim Bazzi, the documents allege. Daniel Alter, former general counsel at the New York Department of Financial Services, which first pursued SCB for breaching sanctions, called the new disclosures shocking and  ""exponentially worse than the bank admitted in 2012. This shows a frightening connection to not just commercial entities, but terrorist organisations, terrorist front companies for organisations such as Hamas, Hezbollah, al-Qaeda, the Taliban - things that make up a regulator's nightmare - and we didn't know that: it was never disclosed to us. And it wasn't apparent in the data that we had, Mr Alter told the BBC. Its a whole different story. SCB, which has its headquarters in London, mostly serves customers in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. When Mr Osborne secretly intervened on the banks behalf, it was at risk of criminal prosecution for money laundering by the US Department of Justice. On 10 September 2012, Mr Osborne wrote to Ben Bernanke, then chair of the US central bank the Federal Reserve, and to then US president Barack Obamas Treasury Secretary, Tim Geithner. He met them the following month. Two months later, the bank was fined $300m but escaped prosecution with a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA), a form of probation for corporations. No individual bank executive was prosecuted. In the same month, Mr Knight approached the US authorities with evidence that the banks misconduct was far worse than it had admitted and continued after 2007. In 2019, SCB agreed a further DPA in relation to transactions between 2007 and 2011 and was fined a further $1.1bn. Both the FBI and US Department of Justice declined to comment. Neither Lord Cameron nor Mr Osborne commented on the record. SCB said it was confident the courts will reject these claims. It said US authorities had previously concluded the whistleblowers claims were meritless and did not show any violations of US sanctions. But the whistleblowers claim the US authorities have perpetrated a colossal fraud on this court by falsely denying that the whistleblowers provided previously unknown, damning evidence. A British bank that escaped prosecution for money laundering carried out billions of dollars of transactions for funders of terrorist groups, US court papers allege. Standard Chartered, one of the UKs largest banks, avoided prosecution by the US Department of Justice after Lord Camerons government intervened on its behalf in 2012. New documents filed to a New York court claim thousands of transactions worth more than $100bn were carried out by the bank from 2008 to 2013 in breach of sanctions against Iran. An independent expert has identified $9.6bn of foreign exchange transactions with individuals and companies designated by the US government as funding terror groups, including Hezbollah, Hamas, al-Qaeda and the Taliban. In a statement, the bank said it disputes the whistleblowers claims, saying their previous allegations had been thoroughly discredited"" by US authorities.

"British hiker, 70, found dead in Pyrenees","A British hiker who went missing in the Pyrenees on Monday has been found dead, Spanish authorities have said. The 70-year-old man, from London, was discovered after his disappearance sparked a search-and-rescue operation. Mountain rescue specialists from the Spanish Civil Guard said he was found at 13:00 local time on Thursday near the Aspe peak in the western Pyrenees, in the north-east of the country. The Civil Guard said the hiker was located by three members of the search-and-rescue team who contacted an air unit, which transferred him to a nearby mountain refuge. The alarm was raised in Spain, it said, at about 18:00 on Monday when the authorities were contacted by Interpol's Manchester office with the co-ordinates of an electronic bracelet the man was wearing. Interpol had concerns he could be either injured or lost. A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: We are supporting the family of a British man who died in Spain and are in contact with the local authorities."
Brockholes: More than 50 objections to housing plans,"An outline application for five homes on a plot of grassland by Oakes Lane in Brockholes has been submitted to Kirklees Council. Landscaping would be determined at a later date, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). An earlier application for seven homes was refused, with those plans deemed to be ""overdevelopment"". The new application will be decided by the council's district planning committee on Thursday due to the amount of objections lodged. Despite this, it said, council officers recommended its approval. Among the objections was the claim the development is an ""accident waiting to happen"" because it is close to the ""well-used"" Duckholes footpath used by schoolchildren. Holme Valley Parish Council also opposed the plans because of ""over-intensification"" of the site, and flooding concerns. However, council officers said they felt concerns had been adequately addressed. A previous application for the same site was refused and the appeal dismissed in 2001 because the proposed access point was ""unacceptable"" on safety grounds. Also cited, was the ""inefficient"" use of the land, and a requirement at the time that meant brownfield sites should be developed before greenfield sites.

Bryan Talbot: The comics legend lurking in a Sunderland basement,"British graphic novelist Bryan Talbot is set to be inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Awards Hall of Fame, the highest accolade for comic writers and artists from across the world. The BBC spent an afternoon with him in his studio. Deep in the basement of a Victorian terrace in Sunderland there lurks a living legend. Dressed all in black with his long silver hair tied back, Bryan Talbot certainly looks the part as he stands at a large drawing board in the semi-subterranean bay window. His walls are lined with shelves of well-thumbed books, from his childhood comic collection to reference works on art and anthropology, Victoriana and zoology. Two bookcases groan under the heft of his own extensive canon of works created over half a century. Born in 1950s Wigan to a coal miner and hairdresser, Bryan's love of comics began before he could even read. The word-free visuals of nursery tales gave way to Rupert The Bear and Giles cartoons strips, before he fell deeply for the Beano and Dandy, first bought for him as he lay in a hospital bed after having his tonsils removed. ""They were just so anarchic,"" he says of Dennis the Menace and the Bash Street Kids. ""Before that, comics were very respectful and genteel. Suddenly teachers, park keepers and even parents were the enemy."" He started drawing his own comics aged about five and excelled in English and art at school. He was supported in his ambitions by his mother, who would sketch out hairstyles for her customers, and his father who enjoyed water colouring. Bryan was the first in his family to attend higher education, studying fine art and graphic design before finding work in the underground comics industry burgeoning in the 1960s and 70s. It was a world of counter-culture, anti-establishment comics from the ""hippy generation"", full of ""sex, drugs, rock and roll"" as well as ""whimsy and surrealism"", Bryan recalls with obvious fondness. ""The important thing these writers did was reclaim comics as an adult medium,"" he says. But he always harboured a fantasy for something much more ambitious - a full novel told in comic form. He tried to create a Lord of the Rings spin-off graphic novel when he was 17, but now says he lacked the skill to pull it off then. He certainly had the talent and experience by 1981 when The Adventures of Luther Arkwright, his science-fiction tale of trans-dimensional wars and alterative histories, was published to wide acclaim. The nine-part story was released as a single volume at around the same time as Raymond Briggs' When The Wind Blows and Posy Simmonds' True Love. ""The three of them are the first British graphic novels,"" Bryan says with a humble pride. As an artist he has collaborated with numerous writers, including Neil Gaiman on the Sandman series, Pat Mills on 2000 AD's Nemesis The Warlock and Alan Moore. But while those ""commercial"" jobs paid the bills, Bryan's passion was always for writing his own stories, including a two-parter for DC Comics in which Batman is all a figment of the imagination of a mentally unwell Bruce Wayne. ""Making up the story is the fun bit, the best bit really,"" Bryan says, adding: ""Drawing it is the hard part."" He always has a notebook in his pocket to jot down ideas, while piles of paper featuring sketches or hastily scribbled thoughts are scattered across his four-storey home. He starts by writing a script, then begins the artwork from page one. Bryan does two pages at a time, always conscious of the psychology of a comic reader to ensure the ""reveals"" in the plot are not prematurely spoiled. His fifth book in the Grandville series even had the final pages bound in black plastic so readers could not inadvertently glimpse the ending. ""People read the text, the speech bubbles or narration, in order, but their eyes are flicking all over both pages,"" he says. It takes about six days to draw two pages, with the work then inked and either painted with water colours or scanned in and digitally coloured. The results have won him multiple awards and accolades. The Tale Of One Bad Rat, Bryan's Beatrix Potter-inspired story about child abuse, won the highly coveted Eisner award in 1996. Two years later, he and his wife Mary moved to Sunderland on the windswept North East coast after she got a job as a lecturer at the city's university. The ""big move"", as Bryan calls it, led directly to one his most creative and critically-lauded works - Alice In Sunderland. ""I think it was therapy for me and helped me cope with living somewhere new,"" he says of the book, which details Sunderland's history and its beguiling links to Lewis Carroll and Alice In Wonderland. The book was a ""hard sell"" as it was unlike anything else on the market, combining artistic styles, history, biography and surrealism. He drew the first 20 pages and showed them to a publisher but they could not grasp the whole concept. ""I had all these ideas for it, the full 320 pages, and I could either shelve it and let it drain away or I could write it,"" Bryan recalls. ""I chose to write it."" ""Thankfully Mary had a good job so I could afford to take the time to do it."" It took three years, at the end of which publisher Jonathan Cape agreed to take it on. ""It was one of my dreams to be published by a big publisher,"" Bryan says, adding: ""It did great, got great reviews."" More glory came in 2012 when Dotter Of Her Father's Eyes, his first collaboration with Mary, won the Costa biography award, becoming the first graphic novel to scoop the prize. ""I always said comics should not just sell to comic fans,"" he says. ""They should be something everybody reads and that book getting that award showed that."" Bryan and Mary's has been a fruitful literary partnership, yielding five books and counting. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 2018, using Lord Byron's pen to sign his name while dressed appropriately in a billowing white shirt. And later this year Bryan will lift his flight ban, self-imposed for environmental reasons, to travel to San Diego Comic Con where he will be inducted into the comics Hall of Fame, joining such illustrious names as Stan Lee, Tove Jansson and Jack Kirby. ""I was amazed and surprised,"" Bryan says. ""I had no idea I was up for it. It's a huge honour."" For now, down in his cellar studio, Bryan's current focus is The Casebook of Stamford Hawksmoor, a prequel to his Grandville series which features anthropomorphised steampunk characters. Grandville is the alternative name for Paris in an early 19th Century where Britain is a part of the French empire. The story follows the exploits of badger detective Archie LeBrock and his elegant rat sidekick as they tackle serial killers, cults and conspiracies. As with much of Bryan's work, in-jokes and references to art and comics burst out of almost every panel, while its aesthetic is turbo-charged Victorian. ""The Victorian style is just a lot more interesting,"" Bryan says. ""The things they used to wear were amazing. ""Look at trains, for example. Nowadays they are like a box on wheels, but I can still remember when I was a child seeing the steam engines which were like these huge fire spitting monsters."" With 110 of the 170 Hawksmoor pages completed, Bryan still has plenty of toil ahead. The 72-year-old has to regularly stop to stretch his fingers and combat the arthritis creeping into his joints. ""I do suffer for my art,"" he says with a laugh, before picking up his pen and heading back to the drawing board. Follow BBC Sunderland on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

Cafe owner praises concerts for boosting trade,"Mr Lionetti, 30, who runs La Piazza cafe on St Paul's Square, with his father Libby Lionetti, said he was due to see Lavigne in 2020, but the gig was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ""It was rearranged and when I saw her, with my wife Emily, at Alexandra Palace last summer, she was pregnant with our daughter Isabella. ""So now Isabella gets to see her twice, when she was in her stomach and now as a baby."" With his father, Mr Lionetti, 58, they have been selling tickets for the concert from their cafe. ""There's a real ripple effect, it means people will come and get a ticket from us, without a booking fee, who might not have come here before and then get a drink or something to eat"", Mr Lionetti said. Both men will be at the gigs, as they will be volunteering for the Beds and Northants MS Therapy Centre, the event's charity partner.

Email eastofenglandnews@bbc.co.uk or WhatsApp us on 0800 169 1830 A business owner has praised a series of concerts, featuring Avril Lavigne, Tom Jones, James and Nile Rodgers, saying they are ""a great thing"" for his town. The acts, which also include Jess Glynne and Pete Tong, will grace the temporary stage at Bedford Park over six nights from 29 June to 7 July. Joseph Lionetti, who lives and works in the town, said the Bedford Summer Sessions show that ""little old Bedford, isn't so little anymore"". ""I've loved Avril for 20 years, seeing her again by my back door is amazing,"" he added. Mr Lionetti, 30, who runs La Piazza cafe on St Paul's Square, with his father Libby Lionetti, said he was due to see Lavigne in 2020, but the gig was cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ""It was rearranged and when I saw her, with my wife Emily, at Alexandra Palace last summer, she was pregnant with our daughter Isabella. ""So now Isabella gets to see her twice, when she was in her stomach and now as a baby."" With his father, Mr Lionetti, 58, they have been selling tickets for the concert from their cafe. ""There's a real ripple effect, it means people will come and get a ticket from us, without a booking fee, who might not have come here before and then get a drink or something to eat"", Mr Lionetti said. Both men will be at the gigs, as they will be volunteering for the Beds and Northants MS Therapy Centre, the event's charity partner.

Caley Thistle player says contract ended while awaiting surgery,"Irish footballer Aaron Doran says his contract with Inverness Caledonian Thistle has been ended while he awaited knee surgery for an injury he sustained while playing. The 33-year-old was 19 when he joined Caley Jags and made almost 400 appearances - including helping the club to win the Scottish Cup in 2015. Inverness, in turmoil following relegation from the Scottish Championship, cancelled Doran's operation last month. It has been paid for with donations by fellow footballers, managers and fans. In a social media post, Doran described his treatment by Inverness as ""disgraceful and unacceptable"". Inverness Caledonian Thistle (ICT) has been approached for comment. Following relegation to League 1, the club announced plans to move its training base 136 miles to Kelty in Hearts. The plan was abandoned after criticism from fans, but concerns remain about the club's future. Doran, who previously played for Blackburn Rovers, is among players not to secure new deals. He said in his post: ""I received my P45 email while awaiting surgery yesterday. ""This being the only time that the club has contacted me."" He added: ""They have shown me no duty of care for an injury which happened playing for them on live TV and have not spoken to me once or any other out of contract player. ""I have not been offered rehab. ""Personally, I find it disgraceful and unacceptable and this should never be allowed to happen."" Doran said his family's home was in the Highlands, and he wanted to thank fans for 14 years of support. His former ICT team-mate Shane Sutherland started a fundraiser to pay for the surgery.

Call for youth support amid drug and violence rise,"His comments came after police put a 48-hour dispersal order in place in Nuneaton last Friday in response to a spate of crime, including the fatal stabbing of 25-year-old Tom Ellis. Mr Armson said while the causes were complex and not all incidents necessarily involved young people, he remained concerned generally about the risks of them becoming involved in crime, and suggested there was a lack of education for them about the dangers. His organisation works with primary and secondary school children, including those who have been exploited or sold drugs, and also serves as an alternative education source. ""We only have access to our young people between [the hours of] nine and three,"" he said. ""They [then] become their parents' responsibility. ""[But those parents] might have two jobs, they might be struggling to make ends meet. [The young people are] left to their own devices. It then becomes so easy for them to be exploited. ""As soon as organised criminals start to realise that Nuneaton is an area of deprivation they go 'hang on a minute, we can start to exploit these young people'. ""The children get a sense of identity they might've never had."" Mr Armson said a lot of organisations were trying to help but they were stretched. ""The lack of funding for public services [is a real issue],"" he said. ""We work with 200 [people], that's not enough. He called for the reinstatement of local government funding to make it easier for organisations to offer youth workshops and activities. ""We need experienced, qualified staff out there to be able to do it,"" he said. Follow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Calls for improved safety on Scotland's second longest road,"Frazer Coupland, Lochaber Chamber of Commerce chief executive, said west Highland residents and businesses, along with visitors to the area, relied on the A82. He warned detours during an incident could be up to 100 miles long. Mr Coupland added: ""We really have to look at the infrastructure and what the west coast is contributing to the Scottish economy through our products."" He said produce included farmed salmon, timber and also aluminium from a smelter in Fort William. Mr Coupland added: ""We need infrastructure to match that contribution. ""The bottom line is the roads are not fit for purpose. They require investment."" Alasdair Ferguson, group managing director at Ferguson Transport and Shipping in Fort William and co-owner of Kishorn Port, said the A82 was challenging for lorry drivers and other motorists. He said: ""To meet large vehicles on that road - it's not safe. ""There are still bits of the A82 further south you cannot actually pass each other without reversing on a trunk road. That's not a good thing."" The A82 links Inverness with central Scotland via Fort William and passes through Glen Coe, Rannoch Moor and Loch Lomond. Figures released by Transport Scotland in 2022 showed that between 2018 and 2021 there were 22 fatal accidents on the A82 - the highest number for Scottish trunk roads. The A82 had the third highest number of non-fatal accidents - 215 - with 257 on the A9 and 403 on the M8. Transport Scotland said it had invested in maintenance and improvements. A spokesperson said a review of collisions on the trunk road network was carried out every year to identify where resources could be targeted to reduce casualties. Business leaders in Lochaber have called for urgent investment to improve Scotland's second longest trunk road. They said stretches of the A82 were unsafe and accidents over the years had resulted in lengthy closures and long diversions. A 35-year-old motorcyclist was killed at Glen Coe at the weekend and the road around the crash site was shut for almost five hours. Since 2007 Transport Scotland said more than £190m had been spent on the A82, which stretches for more than 170 miles from Inverness to Glasgow. Frazer Coupland, Lochaber Chamber of Commerce chief executive, said west Highland residents and businesses, along with visitors to the area, relied on the A82.

Can Biden be replaced as nominee? Not so easy,"Yes, if - and it's a big 'if' - Mr Biden decides to retire, it would be relatively straightforward to find another candidate. The party's nominee will officially be chosen at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago from 19-22 August. The Democrats are planning to nominate Mr Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris virtually before the gathering to comply with a ballot certification deadline in Ohio. There, a candidate must win support from the majority of ""delegates"" - party officials who formally choose the nominee. Delegates are assigned to candidates proportionally based on the results of each state's primary election. This year, Mr Biden won almost 99% of the nearly 4,000 delegates. According to DNC rules, those delegates are ""pledged"" to support the incumbent president. If Mr Biden willingly drops out, it could turn into a free-for-all. Democrats would be left with an open convention where they would suggest potential nominees and continue voting until one receives the majority of delegate votes. That could spark a frantic contest among Democrats vying for a shot at the nomination. Mr Biden has so far given no indication that he would consider stepping aside. But if decides to drop out of the race, ""that opens up an entirely different can of worms"", political historian Leah Wright Rigueur told BBC News. ""I think that if he were to get replaced, part of the negotiation for him stepping down would be that he would get the final say in who replaces him,"" she said. nan This is an even less plausible scenario. And if he doesn't want to go, this is where the process gets really tricky. In the modern political era, a major national party has never tried a hostile takeover of the nomination and there is no evidence of any serious plan to do so now. However, DNC regulations do have some loopholes that could, in theory, make it possible to push Mr Biden out. The rules allow delegates to ""in all good conscience reflect the sentiments of those who elected them"", meaning they could look to someone else. ""It could be an incredibly ugly scenario,"" Ms Wright Rigueur said. Experts told BBC News they doubt there would be a revolt among party delegates. But the DNC can alter party rules at any point. Ms Wright Rigueur pointed to 1968, when President Lyndon B Johnson decided not to run for reelection. The party shifted from an open convention process, in which delegates could cast ballots for whomever they chose, to a bound process, where a delegate was attached to a candidate based on primary results. ""At any point in time, the rules committee can change the rules surrounding how you select a presidential nominee,"" she said. ""Nothing is outside of the realm of possibility,"" she added. Even if Mr Biden were suddenly to exit the race, conservative groups have vowed to file lawsuits challenging the legality of any replacement Democrat's eligibility for the ballot. Vice-President Kamala Harris would automatically take Mr Biden's place if he were to step down during his presidential term. But the same rules do not apply if Mr Biden pulls out as a candidate for November's election race, and there is no mechanism in place that would give the vice-president an upper hand at an open convention. Instead, Ms Harris would have to win the majority of delegates, just like any other candidate. As she is already on the Democratic ticket, Ms Harris could certainly be favoured. But her relatively low popularity among the American public might dull that advantage. Her net disapproval is now lower than Mr Biden's and Donald Trump's, according to FiveThirtyEight. Mr Biden did face challengers from within his party this election cycle, including Minnesota congressman Dean Phillips and writer Marianne Williamson. But both were longshots and neither is likely to rise to the top of any shortlist. There are some calls for California Governor Gavin Newsom, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer or Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro to ride to the rescue. But none of those candidates has publicly declared any wish to supplant the incumbent. The 25th Amendment of the Constitution allows the US vice-president and the majority of the cabinet to declare the president unable to perform the duties of office. If invoked, power is transferred to the vice-president to serve as acting president. This has never happened before. But following Thursday's debate, senior congressional Republicans called on Mr Biden's cabinet to consider invoking this clause. After the US Capitol riot in 2021, the Democratic-controlled House approved a resolution urging then-Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to oust Trump, but the move went nowhere.

Knives are out for President Joe Biden after his poorly received performance in the first 2024 presidential debate against Donald Trump. Democratic sources told the BBC of panic and confusion within the party and discussions about whether Mr Biden, 81, should step down. The New York Times editorial board - the beating heart of the US liberal establishment - said Mr Biden was a ""shadow"" of his former self and should stand aside. But could Mr Biden back out now? What would happen? And who could replace him? The short answer is that unless he agrees to stand aside, it's difficult and could get ugly. Let's run through the scenarios.

Cannabis farmer 'paying debt to people smugglers',"An Albanian cannabis farmer who said he was forced to grow drugs to pay back people smugglers has been jailed for eight months. Jurgen Koxhaj, 23, was found in a house in Middlesbrough with 120 cannabis plants, Teesside Crown Court has heard. He said he had been at the house for a month and was feeding the plants to pay off a £3,000 debt for passage on a boat which illegally brought him to the UK. Koxhaj admitted one count of producing a class B drug. The court heard police raided a home on Marton Road on 29 April and found Koxhaj inside with 120 plants spread across four rooms, including in the loft, with the property's electricity having been bypassed. The plants were ""healthy and in good condition"" and would provide regular yields of between £33,000 and £100,000, prosecutor Cole Cockburn said. Koxhaj said he had been ""pressured"" into feeding and watering the plans by people smugglers to whom he owed money, the court heard. Judge Chris Smith said Koxhaj had lodged an application for asylum but it was ""unlikely"" it would be approved, so he would probably be deported back to Albania after completing his sentence. ""You should go back to Albania and make a life there with your fiancée,"" the judge told Koxhaj, adding: ""I hope you can find work there as a chef."" The judge said the bypassing of the electricity at the house was ""dangerous"", but accepted Koxhaj had not done it. He said Koxhaj played a lesser role in an organisation ""producing significant quantities of cannabis"". Follow BBC Tees on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

Car park charges cut in busy tourist hotspots,"Dorset Council said it had cut prices at its busiest car parks close to the resorts and beaches but a full review was needed before it could implement cuts at more locations. Currently, motorists wanting to stay between one and two hours at The Swannery near Weymouth station must pay £4.50. After 1 July, this will be reduced to £2.30. Those wishing to stay all day will pay £9 instead of £15. Quieter car parks such as Overcombe, at the Preston end of Weymouth beach, will continue charging the higher rate. Campaigner Nigel Sims-Duff, who owns a cafe near The Swannery, said: ""It's a victory for people power. ""While it's a start, we are hoping the trial will be successful and we will see a fairer system of parking charges across the county. ""Our turnover was down about 20% in the two years we've had these high prices. ""In Weymouth, there are still three or four high-price car parks so users might avoid those car parks and use Swannery but if we attract people, obviously the revenue will increase overall for the council.""

Cardiac arrest death student gets first class honour,"Miss Nicholls was studying French and Italian at Trinity Hall, and at the time of her death was abroad in her third year, as part of her four-year degree. She had been working for a publishing company in Paris and just days before her 21st birthday took a hike in the Gorges du Verdon with her flatmate where she collapsed, and died. Nearby hikers - one of whom was trained in first aid - had rushed to help, performing CPR before an air ambulance arrived at the remote spot, but it was too late. After Clarissa's death, her family, from Wandsworth, London - and her friends - threw themselves into raising awareness of heart conditions in young people, and raising funds for ECG screening for others with undiagnosed issues. More than £100,000 has been raised in Clarissa's name, in collaboration with the charity Cardiac Risk in the Young (Cry). Another fundraiser started by her student friends Jessica Reeve and Izzy Winter now stands at more than £50,000. They initially hoped their GoFundMe page - Clarissa's Campaign for Cambridge Hearts - would raise £7,000, which would pay for one day of ECG screening for about 100 young people. But it quickly reached that target and exceeded it. Clarissa should have been expecting to graduate on Thursday and was predicted to complete her studies with the highest honours. A University of Cambridge spokesperson said that the university's policy ""does not allow us to confer a degree on someone who has passed away before completing their course, however, we can issue a certificate honouring their achievement"". In her absence, Clarissa's parents received her certificate.

Cardiff's long-awaited bus station officially opens,"The site is run by Transport for Wales (TfW) which hopes it will improve connectivity as part of the South Wales Metro development. Twenty-five services will operate every hour from the interchange, with the ambition of reaching 60 per hour by the end of 2024. Cardiff Bus will begin to operate a number of its routes out of the new bus station from Sunday. These routes are: Full details on all of Cardiff Bus's routes, including where they depart from, is available here. There are plans for additional bus services - Newport Bus and Stagecoach - to operate out of the station later in the year, according to TfW. Coach firms operating inter-city services across the UK, such as National Express or Megabus, will remain in their current locations elsewhere in the city. The new bus station is a ""modern, clean and safe"" way for passengers to catch a bus, according to TfW. The large hall inside the bus station provides live updates for the train services operating from the nearby Cardiff Central railway station. Staff will be on hand to help point people in the right direction to make their connections. There are public toilets, benches, and eventually there will also be four shops. In at attempt to make the interchange as accessible as possible, there is also tactile paving linking the bus bays with the toilets. Marie Daly, chief customer and culture officer for TfW, described the facility as ""amazing"". ""We're operating as one team across rail and bus to make sure we can offer customers a seamless experience,"" she said. ""We would have loved for it to be open sooner, but what we are focusing on is what a great facility it is."" The old Cardiff bus station was built in the 1950s. By the 2010s, following the construction of the St David's Dewi Sant shopping centre, the bus station and the wider Central Square area was earmarked for redevelopment. Demolition of the old bus station got under way in 2015. A number of nearby office buildings and a former NCP car park were also knocked down. Plans for the new bus station, to the east of the old site, were approved in 2018. In the meantime, a number of new office buildings were built in Central Square. BBC Cymru Wales moved into one of the new office buildings, on the site of the former bus station, in 2020. ""I think it's a good thing,"" said Cardiff bus passenger Tracey Roberts. ""It will definitely improve things that people have somewhere to go and get the bus. ""I've gone past when I've gone to the train. It looks great. But another passenger, Steve Tribble, was less impressed. ""It's poor, it's just too small,"" he said. ""It's in the wrong place. The congestion along here is ridiculous. They took a perfectly good bus station away and we're left with that."""

Caribbean braces as Hurricane Beryl strengthens,"In an address to the nation on Saturday night, the prime minister of Barbados urged residents to look out for their friends, family and neighbours when the hurricane lands. Forecasters say that Hurricane Beryl, which formed Friday night from a tropical storm, already has winds of 130mph as it heads towards the westerly Caribbean islands. They predict that by the time the storm hits the Windward Islands - made up of Dominica, Martinique, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Grenada - there will be ""hurricane-force"" winds, a ""life-threatening"" storm surge and heavy rainfall. Beryl is the second named storm of the season after Tropical Storm Alberto, which made landfall in north-east Mexico on 20 June. The heavy rains of that storm killed four people. Barbados' meteorological service issued warnings of power outages and flash flooding, as the eye of the hurricane is expected to pass about 26 miles (45 km) south of the island. The storm is expected to drop up to six inches (15cm) of rain on Caribbean islands including Barbados. People are boarding up their homes and thronging supermarkets and petrol pumps in the Barbadian capital, Bridgetown. ""We remain absolutely vigilant and need to take every precaution that is possible for ourselves, for our family and for our neighbours,"" Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Motley said on Saturday. In St Vincent and the Grenadines, Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves urged the owners of supermarkets and petrol stations to extend their opening hours before the arrival of the hurricane, adding emergency shelters would open on Sunday evening. Meanwhile, in a briefing shared online by the government of Dominica, meteorologist Ithoma James urged residents to be prepared, warning hurricanes could be ""devastating"". Hurricane season, which runs from 1 June to 30 November, is predicted to be a busy one this year, according to forecasters. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued its most startling warning to date about the current season. Forecasters said there could be up to 25 named storms in 2024. Between eight and 13 of those storms could develop into hurricanes, the NOAA said. Anywhere from four to seven of those storms could strengthen into category three - or more severe - hurricanes. That would be more than double the usual number. Hurricane Beryl is now one of the earliest arrivals of the storms the NOAA warned of. Michael Lowry, a hurricane expert, wrote on social media that it was ""astonishing"" to see a category three-or-more storm forecast ""anywhere in the Atlantic, let alone this far east in the deep tropics"" so early in the season. ""Only 5 major (category 3+) hurricanes have been recorded in the Atlantic before the first week of July. Beryl would be the sixth and earliest this far east in the tropical Atlantic."" Hurricanes are categorised on a scale of one to five - with category five storms carrying the most extreme winds in excess of 155mph (250km/h). The stronger the hurricane, the more damage it is considered capable of inflicting. In the 2023 hurricane season there were 19 named storms."
Case against ammonia murder accused 'deeply flawed',"Prosecutors said Mr Foster was killed in a so-called ""taxing"" raid between drug dealers and the attack on 20 August was the fourth in 11 days organised by defendant Youssef Wynne across South Tyneside. Prosecutor Mark McKone KC has told jurors the attacks, including one in which a woman lost an eye, were carried out by Mr Wynne's ""enforcer"" Paul Fawcett who was assisted on the last three occasions by John Wandless. The prosecutor said jurors should draw an adverse inference from the defendants declining to give evidence. However,  their lawyers said they were entitled not to take to the witness box, the court heard. In his closing speech for Mr Facwett, Francis Fitzgibbon KC told jurors: ""The evidence that purports to identify [Mr Fawcett] is deeply flawed and not nearly enough for you to say you are sure it is him."" He said even if jurors thought he was involved, they could ""not be sure he had the intention"" to ""cause that level of harm to anybody"". Mr Fitzgibbon said there was ""no direct evidence"" linking Mr Fawcett to the ""brutal and horrific attacks"" and the police and prosecution had not arranged for any witnesses to identify the attackers. He said the ""greatest failure"" of the prosecution was the ""lack of conclusive evidence"" they provided and their failure to address the ""real danger of mistaken identification"". Mr Fitzgibbon said there had also been ""not a sausage"" of forensic testing by police at three of the crime scenes and prosecutors had stuck together ""random bits and pieces"" to make ""circumstantial"" evidence. On the issue of not giving evidence, Mr Fitzgibbon said it was Mr Fawcett's ""legal right"" to say to the prosecution ""prove it"" and there was ""simply no need for him to give evidence because the case against him has failed on its own terms"". Mr Fitzgibbon said he was not accusing police officers of a ""malevolent conspiracy"" or ""fitting up"" the men, but rather they were following ""confirmation bias"" about the four who were known to be involved in dealing drugs. He said Mr Fawcett did have ammonia at his house, but it was used for making crack cocaine, adding if he and Mr Wandless had been involved in the attacks they would be the ""world's worst hitmen"" for keeping the ""murder weapon"" at their homes. Mr Fitzgibbon said Mr Foster's death was ""of course a tragedy"" but he was ""deeply involved in the drugs world"" which was a ""dangerous business"". The court has heard Mr Foster made cannabis sweets which Mr Fitzgibbon said was on a ""wholesale"" scale and was ""no doubt lucrative"". He said the prosecution claimed Mr Wynne had hired Mr Fawcett to ""harm or kill"" his ""one time business partner"" Mr Foster, yet he ""had no reason to harm Mr Foster and every commercial reason not to"". Mr Fitzgibbon said: ""Doesn't that explode the [prosecution] theory?"" He also said the victims in the other three attacks were not involved in drug dealing which scuppered the prosecution's claim that ""taxing"" raids were being carried out. In her closing speech, Mr Wandless' barrister Caroline Goodwin KC said the quality of CCTV footage of the various attacks was ""very poor"" and her client could not be identified in any of it. Ms Goodwin said Mr Wandless was friends with Mr Fawcett and the pair exchanged numerous phone calls but the prosecution had put a ""spin"" on those communications, in which what was actually said was not recorded, to suggest her client had been ""recruited"" for the attacks. She said Mr Wandless accepted destroying the car allegedly used to transport Mr Foster's attackers, but that did not mean he was involved in the murder. She said jurors ""might not appreciate the lifestyle"" of Mr Wandless but that did not mean he was guilty. Ms Goodwin said he had admitted being involved in violence and inflicting injury to people previously, but that did not make him a ""killer"". It was for the prosecution to prove his guilt, not for him to prove his innocence so his refusal to give evidence should not be used against him, Ms Goodwin said. ""You cannot be sure [of his guilt] on this evidence and we invite you to find him not guilty,"" Ms Goodwin told jurors. The defendants and their charges are: The trial continues.

Cash-strapped council overspends by £14m in a year,"A cash-strapped local authority needs to take ""immediate action"" after overspending by £14m over the past year, a council report has said. Documents presented to Slough Borough Council leaders also revealed it is at risk of going £11m over its budget this year, with most of the extra money being spent on rising social care costs. The council declared itself effectively bankrupt in 2021 and has tried to balance the books by making cuts, selling assets and raising council tax - but it has not generated the money it needs as fast as it had hoped. The council's cabinet is set to discuss the report's findings on Monday. The council hoped to net £400m from asset sales between March 2022 and the end of March this year, but it fell far short of that goal by raising £223.5m. It said its target of £600m by March 2027 ""proved unrealistic"". Council officers said effective management of its finances was ""critical"" to its recovery, and getting it to a point where it no longer had to rely on asset sales. The rising costs of social care is putting pressure on council budgets all over the country, as both prices and demand for services has increased. Council documents said ""national economic factors have impacted local government"", including inflation and the continuing increase in demand for services, in particular for homelessness and adult social care. Documents also said the unexpected resignation of its top finance boss Adele Taylor in April caused ""a degree of uncertainty"". A ""refreshed"" strategy for council spending covering the period up until April 2028  known as a medium term financial plan  is set to be put to council leaders next month. The most recent one was only approved by the council in March this year. Labour lost control of the council following local elections in May last year and it is now run by the Conservatives with the backing of Liberal Democrats.

Celtic figure with oversized genitals up for sale,"It is estimated to fetch up to £1,500 at the auction. Mr Jemmett said the 2018 rally took place in appalling weather ""with the rain lashing down"". ""The figure was identified as a Celtic fertility figure and [was] subsequently used as a logo by the rally organisers in their promotions,"" he said. ""As a result, detectorists from all over Europe at rallies would ask me if they could see ""Nobby"", who I always keep in my pocket as a constant companion! It is similar to the Cerne Abbas Giant carved into a hill in Dorset, which is now believed to date to the Anglo-Saxon period. Nigel Mills, Noonans' artefact and coin expert at Noonans, said: This unique figure dates from the 1st Century BC, he has an oversized bald head with deep sockets for eyes, wedges for arms and short legs.""

Child bereavement centre marks 35th anniversary,"Ms Stanyon, from Southport, said Raphael was ""a beautiful charismatic little boy"". He was just a few weeks from his second birthday when he died in 2023.

""Losing a child you feel so alone and then actually you come here and you have a cup of tea and a piece of cake and you talk to other people that have been through something similar,"" she added. Diane Barrett, whose 17-year-old son Ryan died seven years ago, said counselling at the centre had enabled her to volunteer by meeting and greeting people. This makes me feel totally normal,"" she said. I make teas, coffee, if people want to chat they can talk to me. A lot of parents open up. We talk about our kids. I show them around the centre and tell them about the things going on.""

Child's comic tale of 'Danger Sausage' goes viral,"A six-year-olds homemade comic book went viral on social media after he sold it to a neighbour for £1. Red Smith, from Brighton, wrote a story based on a character called Danger Sausage, originally the creation of author Jamie Smart. It got more than 1.3m views when the neighbour, Keri Warbis - as well as Mr Smart - shared the comic on social media on Sunday. Red's mother, Amelia Smith, said her young son liked the character so much he decided to write a spin off. The comic opens with the lines: ""One time there was a sausage as you can see. He was no ordinary sausage, he was a danger sausage."" Ms Smith said she didn't know that Red had sold the comic to a neighbour until the following day. Mr Smart, the award-winning author of popular books Bunny Vs Monkey and Looshkin, said he hoped Red would be inspired to keep making ""brilliant"" comics after the ""amazing reaction"". The Kent-based writer told BBC South East: ""Its been so fun watching the reaction to Reds work. ""Hes not only very talented, but hes really funny too. He already has a great skill in making comics! ""Honestly, its amazing that he liked Danger Sausage enough to tell his own stories. ""Im very honoured."" Ms Smith said Red was using his comic book projects as an excuse to stay up writing comics when he's supposed to be going to bed. In a post on X, Ms Warbis said: Bought a comic called Danger Sausage from a little kid who was selling their home made comics on my street. £1 well spent, Id say. Red is already planning a sequel.

Children 'may go hungry without summer meal payments',"Cathy Green, a mother of three teenage boys, said the payments ""made the summer a bit more enjoyable"". ""It just helped take the stress away, it helped take the burden of worrying and stress out,"" she said. ""You knew you had that wee payment for the children to help you. ""You were able to get your shopping, your gas, electric, and not worry about bills coming in."" She said summer should be a time to look forward to, but that losing the money ""just takes that all away, the enjoyment of summer"". In England, Premier League footballer Marcus Rashford previously campaigned for free school meal vouchers to be available during summer holidays. The campaign prompted a U-turn from Boris Johnson in 2020, allowing 1.3m children to claim the free school meal vouchers.

""Families should be looking forward to the summer, they shouldnt be worrying about finding money to put meals on the table."" Bethany also said the people who use the food bank ""are just like anyone else"".

She said she often struggled to provide additional meals at home. When my kids are at school at least I know they have that one main meal that meets their nutritional value, she added. Healthy food is so much more expensive, its not affordable. She also works as a part-time catering assistant across several schools and said staff were helping feed children out of their own pockets during term time. Weve had classroom assistants that are bringing in food, breadsticks, snacks, lots of things under their desks to give to children throughout the day because they know they are hungry. We can see that children that are coming up to the dinner hatcheswe know they need that bit extra."" She said on two occasions she had witnessed pupils consume so much food they made themselves sick. Its within them to know well Im not going to get anything later so lets fill my body up now. Parents whose children avail of free school meals in term time have told BBC News NI they are worried about feeding their families over the summer holidays. The Trussell Trust, which runs foodbanks, called on Stormont to reinstate the school holiday food grant that ended last year. Families of 93,000 pupils had previously received £27 per child per fortnight during the summer break. Northern Ireland is now the only part of the UK where support with food costs for low income families is not available through the summer holidays. The Department of Education said in a statement that it recognises how disappointing this decision has been but said the present financial context meant difficult decisions had needed to be made. The Trussell Trust said it gave out 49% more food parcels to families in Northern Ireland in July and August 2023, after the grant was axed, than it had the year before.

She said she often struggled to provide additional meals at home. When my kids are at school at least I know they have that one main meal that meets their nutritional value, she added. Healthy food is so much more expensive, its not affordable. She also works as a part-time catering assistant across several schools and said staff were helping feed children out of their own pockets during term time. Weve had classroom assistants that are bringing in food, breadsticks, snacks, lots of things under their desks to give to children throughout the day because they know they are hungry. We can see that children that are coming up to the dinner hatcheswe know they need that bit extra."" She said on two occasions she had witnessed pupils consume so much food they made themselves sick. Its within them to know well Im not going to get anything later so lets fill my body up now."
China and EU to hold talks on electric car tariffs,"The risk of soaring Chinese electric car prices in the EU could be easing after both sides agreed to negotiate a planned series of import taxes. Top officials from both regions spoke about the tariffs on a call on Saturday and agreed to discuss them further, though frictions remain. The call marks the first time the two sides have agreed to negotiate since the EU threatened China with electric vehicle (EV) tariffs of up to 38%. The EU said Chinese EVs were unfairly subsidised by its government. In response, China accused the EU of protectionism and trade rule breaches. An EU spokesperson told the BBC the call between Trade Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis and his Chinese counterpart Wang Wentao was candid and constructive. They said the two sides would continue to engage at all levels in the coming weeks. However, the spokesperson also doubled down on the EUs opposition to how the Chinese EV industry is funded. They said any negotiated outcome to the proposed tariffs must address the injurious subsidisation of Chinese EVs. China released a similar statement on Saturday and made clear it still disagreed with the EU. As well as its call with the EU, Mr Wang met German Vice-Chancellor and Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Action Robert Habeck on Saturday. In a Facebook post about the meeting, Chinas Ministry of Commerce said it had told Mr Habeck about its firm opposition to the tariffs. It repeated its threat to file a lawsuit with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to firmly defend its legitimate rights and interests. Germany has also expressed criticism of the tariffs. When the EU first proposed them last week following its investigation of Chinese EVs in the trading bloc, Germany's Transport Minister, Volker Wissing, said the move risked a ""trade war"" with Beijing. ""The European Commission's punitive tariffs hit German companies and their top products,"" he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, at the time. The European car industry has been critical too. Stellantis - which owns Citroën, Peugeot, Vauxhall, Fiat, and several other brands - said it did not support measures that ""contribute to the world fragmentation [of trade]"". The proposed charges range from 17.4% to 38.1%, depending on the brand and how much they negotiated with the EU's investigation. They would come on top of the current rate of 10% levied on all electric cars produced in China. The EU's intervention comes after the US made the much bolder move of raising its tariff on Chinese electric cars from 25% to 100% last month."
China car firms seek 25% tax on EU - state media,"Chinese car companies have called on Beijing to hit European Union rivals with import taxes of up to 25% if the trading bloc imposes tariffs on vehicles from China, the country's state media has reported. The demand was reportedly made at a closed-door meeting organised by China's Ministry of Commerce, which was also attended by representatives of European car  firms. The measures would target cars from the EU with large petrol-driven engines. Last week, the EU threatened Chinese electric vehicle (EV) makers with tariffs of up to 38% from 4 July. The meeting in Beijing was attended by four Chinese and six European car companies, according to an article published by a social media account affiliated with state broadcaster CCTV. German car making giant Volkswagen has confirmed to the BBC that it was present at the meeting but declined to comment on what was discussed. Porsche declined to comment, while BMW did not immediately reply when contacted by the BBC. ""China's car companies called on the government to adopt firm countermeasures against the EU,"" the report said. ""It is suggested that within the limits allowed by Word Trade Organization rules, a higher provisional tariff be imposed on large-displacement petrol vehicles imported from Europe."" The reports echo an article published last month by the state-run newspaper Global Times, which said 25% tariffs should apply to cars with petrol engines larger than 2.5 litres. The move would target ""luxury or ultra luxury"" vehicles, meaning ""an  additional tax is not likely to make much of a difference on volumes,"" Bill Russo, from advisory firm Automobility, told the BBC. The EU's governing European Commission (EC) announced last week that it had ""provisionally concluded"" that Chinese EV manufacturers will face tariffs ""should discussions with Chinese authorities not lead to an effective solution"". Firms that co-operated with the investigation, which was launched in October, will face an average 21% duty, while those who did not could face one of 38.1%. These charges would come on top of the current rate of 10% tariff levied on all electric cars produced in China. The EU's intervention comes after the US made the much bolder move of raising its tariff on Chinese electric cars from 25% to 100% last month. The Chinese government has denounced the decisions as protectionism and has since started taking retaliatory measures. Earlier this week, China launched an investigation into imports of European pork products. Last month, Beijing signalled a similar move by launching an investigation into imports of chemicals from the EU and US."
China honours woman who died saving Japanese family,"A Chinese woman who tried to shield a Japanese mother and her child from a knife attack has died. Hu Youping was working as a school bus attendant in Suzhou city when a man attacked a Japanese woman and her child at a bus stop outside a Japanese school. She suffered serious injuries while trying to restrain him. Tributes for her have poured out online and the local government has said she will be given the title of ""Righteous and Courageous Role Model"". The Japanese embassy in China also lowered its flag to half-mast to honour Ms Hu. In a statement on Weibo, the embassy said it was ""saddened"" to hear of her death. ""We believe [Ms Hu's] courage and kindness also represent that of the Chinese people. We pay tribute to her righteous deeds. May she rest in peace,"" it said. There was also an outpouring of condolences and praise on Chinese social media. ""We will remember your kindness and bravery, for you protected the safety of our Japanese friends and preserved the reputation of ordinary Chinese people,"" read a comment on Weibo. Another described Ms Hu as an ""ordinary, virtuous, courageous Chinese sister"". The mother and son were hurt in Monday's attack but their injuries were not life-threatening. The suspect, a 52-year-old Chinese man, was arrested at the scene. It followed another stabbing earlier this month, which injured four US university instructors at a park in Jilin, in China's north-east. Chinese officials had said the two attacks were ""isolated"" incidents. Chinese state newspaper Global Times ran an editorial on Friday paying tribute to Ms Hu, where it also claimed that ""China is undoubtedly still one of the safest countries in the world"". Separately, the newspaper reported that Weibo had removed 759 posts that ""incited nationalist sentiment"" following the attack. These posts contained ""extreme opinions"" that ""promoted group hatred and even applauded criminal behaviour in the name of patriotism"". The stabbing in Suzhou sparked concern among the local Japanese community and led the embassy to issue a safety alert warning its citizens living in China to take precautions while they are out. China's foreign ministry said the incident was ""regrettable"" and that it will ""continue to take effective measures to earnestly protect the safety of all foreigners in China"". China has seen a spate of knife attacks in the past year. In May, two people were killed and 10 others injured in such an attack at a primary school in the southern Jiangxi province. Another stabbing that same month saw two dead and 21 wounded at a hospital in Yunnan. In July last year, six people, including three children, were killed in a stabbing at a kindergarten in the south-eastern province of Guangdong."
Church scaffolding to stay despite removal claims,"Project director Sandy Matthew said his claim that the grant will mean the scaffolding can be taken down is true, as it has partly funded the work and encouraged further investment. The NLHF gave St Peter's £250,000 to use on events celebrating 200 years since it was built. Mr Matthews said in April the NLHF grant would fund celebratory events and further restoration work on the tower. The funding will enable the church to finally remove the scaffolding which has remained in situ since 2014,"" he added. Despite this, St Peter's is now asking the public for £20,000 to pay for more restoration work in September. The work will cost £180,000. The church said it will use £72,000 of the NLHF grant, £5,000 in congregation money and £20,000 generated by the public to partly pay for the work. It means St Peters would then need to raise a further £83,000 through investments before work can begin. Mr Matthews said: ""We need the crowdfunding campaign to help us [complete the work]. ""Whatever we raise, will go towards it so we can remove the scaffold."" Follow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

Classic cars 'upcycled' to electric,"A company is converting classic Land Rovers and Porsches to electric power to make more sustainable vehicles. Older cars increasingly cannot drive in city centre low-emission zones, but Everrati, based in Upper Heyford, Oxfordshire, is removing petrol engines and mechanical drivetrains built more than half a century ago and replacing them with batteries. ""Creating a brand new car uses up to 20 tonnes of CO2,"" founder and chief executive Justin Lunny told me. ""A car made 60 years ago is hugely sustainable,"" he added. One in six new cars is now powered by batteries. Everrati's latest prototype is a 1964 Mercedes Pagoda, an iconic two-seat sports car of the type once owned by John Lennon, John Travolta and, more recently, Harry Styles. The car has been developed in a discreet workshop out of sight on a former US Air Force base. Each car is built to order and does not come cheap. A good Pagoda sells for about £200,000 at classic car auctions. A customer pays Everrati about £330,000 to replace the engine with a battery, and restore every part of the vehicle to as-new showroom condition. Everrati built its first car three years ago. It has 20 on the road, and 12 more are being built in Oxfordshire and at a site in California. ""It's not for everybody,"" Mr Lunny admitted. ""It's very expensive. But we're creating something that will hopefully last a lifetime. ""We have people creating these with - and for - their children, because they want that legacy."" He is now building six Land Rovers for a client in Dubai. Another is in the Hamptons outside New York. ""Buyers are usually wealthy people who love the idea of something that is now fully sustainable and reusable,"" he explained. ""It's the ultimate upcycling."" Chief engineer Tony Fong demonstrated the controls on the Pagoda for me. ""The gearstick has been modified,"" he said. ""Pull towards you for drive, push away for reverse. The gauge for the fuel tank now shows battery capacity. When this was built there were no hazard lights. We are engineering those in."" Fashionable restaurants What is it like to drive? On the former airfield's perimeter road, it is much noisier than newer electric cars. It is a work in progress, full of quirky character. I've driven a lot of classic cars, and this feels very different. Because it is battery-powered, it has more performance now than when the original petrol car was built. It has a smaller range than a modern mass-produced car, and it charges more slowly too. There are no seatbelts, no airbags or traction control. But it will be fitted with air conditioning to suit today's clients. Such luxury was not available 60 years ago. The car is no motorway mile-muncher. It is more likely to be seen in Instagram poses outside fashionable restaurants or summer parties than on a touring holiday. With a total price tag above £500,000, this is a niche market. Most will be sold in North America and the Middle East. Mr Lunny believes he could build 100 cars a year with his 20 staff. Beyond that, the ambition is to sell his bespoke battery and drivetrain technology to other carmakers. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Company fined more than £2m over drowning death,"A construction company has been fined more than £2m after a worker drowned while working on a flood defence project in Leeds. Gary Webster, 60, was one of two men on a boat trying to retrieve a gas canister from the bottom of weir gates at Knostrop Weir on the River Aire when the boat capsized. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said he was rescued by a diver after almost 15 minutes and was taken to hospital but died two days later, on 1 November 2017. His colleague managed to swim to safety. Employer BAM Nuttall Ltd pleaded guilty to breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act and was fined £2,345,000 at Leeds Magistrates' Court. The company, based in Camberley, Surrey, was also ordered to pay £25,770 in costs during the hearing on Wednesday. Concerns had been raised by Kevin McLoughlin, senior coroner for West Yorkshire (East). He had recorded Mr Webster's cause of death as from cardiac arrest, multiple organ failure and cold water immersion - noting that there was a risk of further deaths unless the company took preventative action. An HSE investigation found BAM Nuttall Ltd could have slowed down the flow of the water at the weir by using the gates, but failed to do so. It said the company had several operatives who were trained and authorised to control the weir gates, which would have allowed the debris to float away or be reached safely by boat. HSE inspector Jayne Towey said BAM Nuttall Ltd failed to plan the work or to carry out any assessment of the risks involved. This incident could so easily have been avoided by simply carrying out correct control measures and safe working practices, she said. A spokesperson for BAM Nuttall apologised to Mr Webster's family. They said: We deeply regret that failures in our safety management allowed this incident to occur. Everyone should go home safe at the end of a days work. The fact Gary did not is a matter of solemn reflection. Safety remains our number one priority as a business. We have always held our hands up in relation to the events at Knostrop Weir and said we could have, and should have, done more to protect Gary. They added: Whilst we cannot turn back the clock, we commit to doing our best to stop any similar incident happening in the future at any site we control. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

"Compensation process broken, says RAF veteran","Mr Hewitt was medically discharged from the Armed Forces in 2003 and since then he has suffered from chronic pain. Any veteran who has an injury or illness as a result of service can apply for financial compensation from one of two schemes run by Veterans UK, a veterans service managed by the Ministry of Defence (MoD). The Armed Forces Compensation Scheme is in place for injuries on or after 6 April 2005. Anything before, is handled by the War Pension Scheme. Veterans have long criticised both schemes. Some say they reject claims unfairly, and are slow to resolve them. The BBC's File on 4 programme has been told in some cases it's taken almost 12 years for a final decision to be made. Mr Hewitt applied for compensation from the War Pension Scheme. At first Veterans UK assessed his condition and offered him a one-off payment of about £7,700. But no longer being able to work, Mr Hewitt took Veterans UK to a tribunal. With help from a solicitor, he appeared before a judge to share evidence from his medical records. Mr Hewitt won the tribunal and was awarded a pension of about £2,000 a month. But years later in 2016, his health began to deteriorate with new symptoms like headaches, fatigue and a burning pain in his hands and feet. He was diagnosed with functional neurological disorder and reported his change of condition to Veterans UK hoping to have his pension reassessed. His claim was rejected. Mr Hewitt took Veterans UK to tribunal once again, with the help of his father. He told the BBC the process of doing so, whilst coping with the condition, was demanding. ""That added stress, certainly in my case with functional neurological disorder, makes things worse physically."" He said he was ""utterly debilitated"" by the process. In 2021 he won once again. He said he believed the compensation process was ""broken"" and believed there was a ""determination of the system and people within the system, to see what they can get away with"". LISTEN: File On 4 on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 BST on Tuesday or on BBC Sounds. A record high number of complaints were made about Veterans UK to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman in 2023/24, rising tenfold since 2019. In the last financial year the ombudsman received 31 complaints  compared to three in 2019. In 2023, the complaints system was restructured by Veterans UK, yet the Ombudsman has told the BBC it was unsure why they had seen such a big increase. Mr Hewitt said he hoped constructive change would be made for all veterans who applied to both schemes ""as they fail to treat us in the way that we deserve"". The MoD told the BBC under both schemes, it ensured all those who have an illness or injury caused by their service ""receive the compensation they were entitled to"" and the process was designed to not be ""onerous"". The MoD added even when the tribunal does reach a different conclusion, it does not mean the ""decision made by Veterans UK was wrong"". It encouraged all veterans requiring advice or support to get in touch and said it was always ""looking to improve its processes"" and had adopted ""a number of recommendations following a regular review"".

Consultation opens for 50-acre battery park,"If approved by Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council, the battery park would be built in three phases, with the first phase creating 1GW of storage capacity which could last for four hours. The second phase would improve efficiency, while the third would extend the park's ability to store power to seven hours. If planning permission is granted, phase one's construction would begin in 2027 and is expected to end in December 2028. Phase two is expected to be completed by 2030 and phase three by 2035. The gigapark will use lithium-ion batteries to store energy until it is needed. The park will also include a battery management system, which monitors the health of the batteries, and a ventilation system to keep them cool. A substation connecting the battery park to the National Grid is also expected to be built on the site.

Council backs hackney carriage fare hike,"The fixed fee increase would apply to two tariffs between 07:00 and 00:00 each day. It excludes pricing structures covering bank holidays and the festive period, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Proposals also include a 50p increase to the additional charge when drivers carry five of more passengers, which is currently £2.50. All 81 hackney carriage owners in the borough were consulted on the proposal, with 16 in favour, eight against and the remaining making no comment. The proposed tariffs are the highest that can legally be charged, but drivers are allowed to reduce their fares if they want, according to local authority chiefs. Councillor Carole Thompson described the proposed increase as ""perfectly reasonable"", while councillor Ben Clayton said it was ""proportional"" and ""quite small in the grand scheme of things"".

Council backs reopening of Bank junction to taxis,"Currently, only buses and pedal cyclists are allowed to cross Bank junction or travel westbound on Cornhill between 0700-1900, from Monday to Friday.

Council make U-turn on bridge repairs,"The council had planned to remove the existing road surface and repair the concrete below, and to replace steel within the bridge. Ms Ramsay, who lives on the south side of the river, said she understood the bridge needed to be refurbished but the fact its closure meant a lack of pedestrian access across the River Wear for 20 weeks was a major oversight. ""If we don't have a pedestrian crossing, we can't get to the pharmacy, we can't get to any social things,"" she said. She said there was a nearby field that had footpaths which people used to cross the river, but it was not flat and would be difficult if someone was carrying shopping or had mobility issues. The road closure would have also meant a 35-mile round trip by car across the river from Ms Ramsay's village, she said. The council had not detailed to residents why the repairs had to be done and had ""gone about it all wrong"", Ms Ramsay added. ""Repair the bridge, but make temporary arrangements,"" she said. Independent councillor John Shuttleworth said it was important to ""listen to the views of residents and road users"" and the council would try and find out how to minimise impact on residents when it did the works in the future. It is now looking to do the work next spring. Follow BBC North East on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram. Send your story ideas to northeastandcumbria@bbc.co.uk."

Council pays £25m in one year on school taxis,"Councils are required by law to provide free transport for children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) who are unable to walk to school. Recent BBC research found council spending across England on school transport for SEND placements had almost doubled in the last five years. Across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, the cost of providing taxis has spiralled. In the 2021-22 financial year, Cambridgeshire County Council provided taxis for 4,105 pupils. By 2023-24 that figure had risen by a couple of hundred, to 4,364. But in money terms, providing pupils with taxis went from costing £17,696,173 to £25,630,907 - a rise of almost £8m, equating to 5% of the council's overall spend last year. Peterborough has also seen cost rises. The 2021-22 financial year saw the city council spend £2,920,167. By 2023-24, that figure grew to £4,745,959, based on 789 pupils using taxis. The charity Family Voice Peterborough, which looks to improve services for children with disabilities and additional needs, said: ""School SEND transport is an integral part of many parent-carers' lives. It allows them to go to work, it allows siblings to walk to school with their parents and allows those with a disability to establish a routine. ""Many children would not get to school on time otherwise. It relieves stress for the parents, as well as the child."" Lisa's son James goes to a special needs school in Peterborough. She told the BBC: ""School transport allows me to meet work commitments and keep James in a regular routine, and gives James a sense of independence."" Cambridgeshire County Council said costs associated with journeys were also higher due to a shortage of specialist transport providers providing wheelchair accessible vehicles and longer distances often involved in accessing specialist schooling. ""Future budgets will always prioritise continuing to deliver on our statutory obligations, such as Home to School Transport,"" the authority said.

Providing Home to School Transport for those eligible is a statutory duty for all councils. Peterborough City Council spent nearly £5m in its past financial year.

Council refunded £1.5m to 'gagged' leaseholders,"A London council has been forcing residents into silence as a condition of them receiving money owed to them for building work and services they had been overcharged for - in some cases by tens of thousands of pounds. Lambeth Council was asked by the BBC how many leaseholders it had asked to sign  confidentiality clauses or non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) over a period of five years. It said 136 residents had entered into confidentiality agreements. The Labour-run council has paid out nearly £1.6m in building works refunds to these residents, at an average of more than £11,500 per case. Leaseholders have told the BBC how they were refunded after being charged for shoddy work to their homes - and sometimes for work that never took place at all. They had to make a legally binding commitment not to tell anyone - including their neighbours - about this. Lambeth Council has about 9,400 leaseholders and is the freeholder of many flat blocks. It owns some properties outright as council homes. When major works are needed on a building, such as window and roof repairs or external painting, the costs are divided up between the leaseholders and the council. Leaseholders are obliged to pay for their share of the work as a condition of their lease. Speaking about the council's demands for secrecy, Tracey Gregory, who has owned her home in Lambeth for 23 years and whose bill was eventually cut by the authority, told BBC London: They dont want us to tell our neighbours so they cant apply for the same reductions."" We asked the council why it legally prevents people from telling others about their refunds and it said this was ""to avoid other leaseholders from using arguments made in separate and unrelated disputes. This enables the council to handle disputes on a case-by-case basis. Just before Christmas in 2016, Tracey received a notice that work on her street was estimated to cost her about £12,000. She understood that it needed doing and paid the bill. The work was completed in 2017 but she did not receive a final bill until 2020 - which was for £21,000. She says others received final bills of between £15,000 and £65,000. We are just regular people with regular jobs; we dont have thousands of pounds lying around when you get the final bill you have to pay within 10 days, she says. The contractors had billed the council a total of £2.6m for work to the homes on Traceys side of the street. She says they were charged for loft insulation and the replacement of guttering and downpipes - work that was not done. A breakdown that has been seen by the BBC showed that £37,000 had been charged for replacing gates. They said they had replaced all of the side gates - they hadnt, Tracey says. After years of going back and forth with Lambeth Council, she says she was offered a refund of 36% but when the paperwork came through it had an NDA attached. She refused to sign it - leaving her able to speak to the BBC without fear of legal reprisals. They said you have to sign it or we will retract our offer, Tracey says. In a statement, the council justified the use of these clauses, stating: Confidentiality is one of the cornerstone principles of mediation. It added that the settlements were used to resolve disputes and avoid the stress, time, costs, and incurrence of court resources . The BBC has seen an email from Lambeth Council to Tracey stating that she would have to pay the full amount as she had not signed the settlement deal. When she sought legal advice, the council backed down. It has been estimated by a volunteer group that the council overpaid the contractors £720,000 for the project on her street. Tracey says the practice of silencing leaseholders is completely unreasonable, adding: The only reason companies use NDAs is to hide something."" She also believes the council has been trying to hide its poor contract management. The contractors are being paid for work they are not doing, so to protect their own finances [the council] pursues leaseholders to the nth degree when, actually, they should be pursuing the contractors, she says. Tracey says some residents in their 80s were told to go to the bank and get a loan to pay what they owed. She and others helped get the costs down for elderly neighbours but she says arguing with the authority for five years has taken its toll. It takes a lot of strength to keep battling, she says. The council told BBC London that a confidentiality provision... is not the same as a standalone non-disclosure agreement, but it added that it was changing the way it approached entering into these agreements. It said: Having received bespoke external legal advice, the council has been advised to improve its processes and introduce best practice by asking parties to sign a confidentiality agreement before any potential negotiation. Another leaseholder, Emma - not her real name - says she was told by the council that her share of the cost of the works to change the windows and repaint the exterior to her building could be nearly £70,000. She challenged the council, and was later to discover it had contacted her mortgage adviser to say she was in breach of her lease. Emma eventually managed to get the bill down to £26,000, which she paid, but she still believes she was overcharged and says the standard of the work done was terrible. She says the experience was so incredibly stressful she sold her flat because she wanted to get away. Publicly available data shows the highest refund given by Lambeth Council was £63,000. This suggests that if that individual had not fought the bill, they would have been overcharged by tens of thousands of pounds. In a freedom of information request, BBC London asked the council whether it knew how many other leaseholders were entitled to a payout. It said: Settlement agreements are tailored to address the unique factual circumstances... it would not be appropriate or possible to extrapolate the outcome of a particular individual matter and apply it unilaterally across multiple properties or large-scale major works contracts. BBC London has spoken to three people who say they had to sign an NDA to get some of their money back after being overcharged. One of them, Richard - not his real name - said: They do it to silence you so you cant tell your neighbours. He was refunded several thousand pounds after an independent surveyor confirmed the cost of repair work to the exterior of his building had been inflated, and that he should only have been charged a quarter of what he was originally billed - which was more than £10,000. The BBC is not revealing the exact figure to protect the identity of Richard, who says: At the very least, its gross negligence from the council. Antony Wynn from the Lambeth Homeowners' Association, which has about 1,000 members, says he has heard many stories like Tracey's, Emmas and Richard's. My telephone never stops ringing off the hook every day. Theres been horrific stories, and it just goes on and on. He says the council is being consistently overcharged by contractors and is passing on massive bills to its leaseholders and, despite repeatedly acknowledging the overcharging, is not investigating the issue properly. The total attitude and culture of the council is pushing back and not even beginning to want to address the problem, he says. Rather than investigating, officers threaten people with repossession if they do not pay up, Antony says, adding: People end up as nervous wrecks; we have had people on our forum feeling suicidal. He says after long disputes, some residents have won back up to £40,000. He describes the scale of the overcharging as mind-blowing"" and believes the use of confidentiality agreements shows the council is ""trying to hide their own mismanagement. Lambeth Council told us: We work hard to ensure that all the work is carried out as professionally and economically as possible. Contracts are tendered under established rules, and we have a team of professionals who ensure the comprehensive management and auditing of all the works, costs and progress. The council makes an estimate of the costs, and then charges leaseholders, who have the option of paying in installments. We are happy to discuss any issues with leaseholders and work with them to resolve any issues. Another leaseholder involved in the fight with the council is Alasdair Ross. The software engineering manager said he was in shock when a bill for £18,000 arrived at his flat in Brixton. He told BBC London how he experienced a rush of cold sweat - how am I going to find that money? He says the letter requested he pay in full within 30 days, or he could pay £300 a month for five years, on top of what he describes as his obscene service charge of £640 a month. Alasdair says the work for a new central heating system in his block had been planned three years before he moved in and he had not been notified of any works or upcoming bills in the four years he had been there. Challenging the bill took him about 18 months and, in that time, he says he was sent threatening letters by the council telling him it would contact his mortgage provider to say he was in breach of his lease - which the council did. Alasdair, who did not have to enter into a confidentiality agreement, says that after a long process, the council conceded it had not consulted on the work correctly and his bill was capped at £250. He says he asked council officers if they would inform the other 36 leaseholders about the mistake but was told they would not. I was just appalled, he says. For a public body to continue taking money when they know theyve made a mistake, that just seems wrong. A Lambeth Council spokesperson said: As a landlord, the council is responsible for day-to-day repairs, maintenance and major works at our buildings, to ensure they are safe and secure for all our residents. Under the terms of their lease agreements, leaseholders, as well as the council, are required to pay a share of the costs of this work. Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

Council to borrow £8m for shopping centre work,"Eldon Square has had a difficult few years which has seen the centres value fall, according to the local democracy reporting service. The most recent financial accounts of Intu Debenture, which owns the other 60% of the centre, put the valuation of Eldon Square at £71.2m in 2022, down from £93.2m the year before. Under the redevelopment plan, the top floor of the ex-Debenhams unit would have live music and theatre, a bar and dining area, an outdoor roof terrace, street food stalls and a microbrewery. Clothing retailer Next would move from its existing spot into two floors of the former Debenhams store while beauty brand Sephora is set to open a shop later this year. The second part of the project would see a redesign of the former Eldon Leisure Centre with attractions such as an electric go karting circuit, batting nets, mini golf, bowling and virtual reality games created. At a meeting of the council's finance and budget scrutiny committee, head of property Paul Stewart said the loss of Debenhams had been a ""big challenge"" for Eldon Square but the move to relocate Next was ""very good news"".

A council will borrow almost £8m to help pay for a major redevelopment of a shopping centre. Eldon Square in Newcastle is set to undergo a £65m overhaul which would see the former Eldon Leisure Centre and the top floor of the vacant Debenhams turned into new food, leisure and entertainment spaces. Newcastle City Council, which holds a 40% stake, has agreed to take out a £7.8m loan to contribute to the development, which it is claimed would create up to 900 jobs.

Council under fire for £134m art collection,"The council owns nearly 38,000 works of art, including five by Bristol street artist Banksy, with each worth an average of more than £3,500. But only 4,245 pieces - 11.2% - are on public display, said the Local Democracy Reporting Service. In February, councillors approved City Hall's annual budget which contained £39.3m of cuts over the next five years, including £24m for 2024/25, after finance officers warned that the authority faces a peak funding shortfall of £32.2m in the period up to 2028/9. The number of art items and proportion on public display was revealed in a response to the TaxPayers' Alliances' Freedom Of Information request, which it sent to all 397 councils and resulted in a report by the organisation in May called 'Wasting Monet?'. Bristol City Council withheld the total value of the collection but this is included in its own annual draft accounts, published earlier this month. This meant it was not included in a table in the report naming the UK's top 10 local authorities who own the most expensive amount of artwork. If it had, the city council would have been third, behind Manchester's £384m and Southampton with £190m - but ahead of fourth-placed Leeds which has a £110m art collection. The average local authority collection's is worth £8.7m, of which only 28% is on public display, with Bristol's collection valued far higher and its proportion on show much lower. The Taxpayers' Alliance said that despite being in nearly £100bn of combined debt, UK councils had built up art collections worth almost £1.5bn. Report author Jonathan Eida said: These findings wont paint a pretty picture for hard-pressed taxpayers who have been hammered year after year by record-busting council tax hikes."" Bristol's collection of 37,983 works of art is nearly 15 times bigger than the National Gallery's and six times that for the average council. A Bristol City Council spokesperson said: Bristol museums collection is a vital part of the citys cultural and educational offer, with a value that extends beyond an insurers estimate. Although some may call for cultural assets to be sold off, there are ethical principles and standards of practice that museums are expected to uphold and promote, which include how collections are treated and the sale of items for financial purposes.""

Council warning over backstreet butt lifts,"nan An urgent warning has been issued to people seeking cosmetic procedures including Brazilian butt lifts and breast augmentation - amid fears unregulated surgery is taking place in local hotel rooms. Manchester Council issued the warning on Wednesday, saying procedures ""may be taking place this week in Manchester in non-clinical settings"". Medical experts have cited the risk of infection in non-clinical settings, where it can be difficult to prevent contamination. A statement urged people who are only notified of their surgery's location shortly before treatment to contact the environmental health department at the council. nan The council has been made aware that certain cosmetic procedures  specifically Filler Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) [or] breast augmentation  may be taking place this week in Manchester in non-clinical settings, said the statement, as reported by The Local Democracy Reporting Service. If you are offered treatments in other types of non-clinical premises, such as hotel rooms, or you book a treatment and dont receive the location where the treatment will be carried out until shortly beforehand, we would urge you to contact Manchester City Council environmental health on 0161 234 5004 - so the council can ensure that any procedures will be carried out in accordance with the required health and safety and infection control procedures. A Brazilian Butt Lift typically involves doctors transferring fat from a patients belly, hips, lower back, or thighs to their buttocks. It is sometimes called gluteal fat grafting, buttock augmentation with fat grafting, and safe subcutaneous buttock augmentation (SSBA). Breast augmentation, colloquially known as a boob job, typically involves enhancing the shape of a patients breasts.

Councillor who filmed and swore at rival convicted,"A councillor who confronted a political rival in the street, swore at him and called him a ""scumbag"" has been found guilty of abusive behaviour but cleared of an assault charge. Cheshire West and Chester Councillor Simon Boone started filming Councillor Stuart Bingham who was canvassing for the Labour party in Winsford ahead of the local elections, South Cheshire Magistrates Court heard. Boone, 56, then told him he was a ""vile man"" and tried to stop him passing. The court heard he claimed Mr Bingham's leaflets, being hand out on Swanlow Lane on 30 April last year, were part of a ""smear campaign"" against him and another councillor. Boone, who represents Winsford Swanlow, was found guilty of using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour to cause harassment, alarm or distress. Mr Bingham had also alleged Boone had pushed him, but after being shown mobile phone footage and CCTV, magistrates said there was not enough clear evidence to convict on the assault charge. Mr Bingham, who now represents Winsford Over and Verdin, said he had already been approached by a woman, before two men, including Boone, had accosted him. The Local Democracy Reporting Service said Boone, who was elected to represent Winsford Salt of the Earth in May last year but now sits as an independent, had told Mr Bingham what he was doing was illegal, adding: ""The election's over"". He swore at him and sidestepped from left to right as Mr Bingham tried to get past, the court heard Mr Bingham told magistrates: Since it happened Ive changed the locks, got CCTV and my wife has had panic attacks. Boone argued that after being tipped off to Mr Binghams location, he had gone there to ""gather evidence"" about the alleged smear campaign. He received a fine of £415, a surcharge of £166 and was ordered to pay a contribution to costs of £300.

Councils open emergency voting booths after postal ballot delays,"The council said it was prioritising people who will not be at home next week and urged anyone who is not leaving the country to wait for delivery of their postal vote. But it added that anyone who has not had their pack by early next week should contact the council. More than 92,000 postal votes were sent out in Edinburgh last week - although it is not known how many have not been received. The council said another 11,000 should reach people on Friday or Saturday. The surprise decision by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to call a July election has posed additional challenges in Scotland as schools broke up this month for the summer holidays. As a result many families will be out of the country on polling day. Paul Lawrence, returning officer for Edinburgh, said: ""I appreciate the concerns of voters on this issue and my absolute priority is to ensure everyone has the opportunity to exercise their democratic right to vote in this general election. ""Thats why we've taken the decision to put in extra resources and open the City Chambers this weekend. ""Please only attend if you havent received your postal vote and youre going on holiday or wont be at home next week."" Mr Lawrence also encouraged anyone who has already received their postal vote to return it as soon as possible, through Royal Mail. He added: ""The timing of this election has been challenging as have other circumstances beyond our control, but our teams are working hard to ensure it passes off as smoothly and successfully as possible."" The returning officer for Fife, Ken Gourlay, said: ""The printers and Royal Mail are doing everything they can to ensure that all postal packs are delivered by Monday July 1. However, we appreciate that voters are concerned and thats why were opening Fife House tomorrow. ""Please only attend if you havent received your postal vote and youre going on holiday or wont be at home next week."" The Electoral Commission has said anyone who applied before the deadline on Wednesday 19 June, and had their application approved, should receive their ballot pack through the post ""in the coming days"". A spokesperson said: ""As is the case at all elections, given the electoral timetable, there is a short window of time for administrators to prepare and dispatch postal votes. ""It is not uncommon for all postal ballots to not have arrived at this point. If a voters postal ballot pack does not arrive in time, there may still be options available to voters, such as requesting a replacement from their local authority. ""If voters are concerned their postal vote wont be sent back in time, they also have the option of handing their postal pack to their polling station on polling day."" Christine Walker, who lives in Dumfries and Galloway, is one of the thousands of people around the country who have been affected. She is going on holiday on Monday and feels she has been denied the right to vote by the ""ineptitude"" of the authorities. ""I'm 77 years old. This is the first time I've ever had to apply for a postal vote and I'm not impressed,"" she told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. ""I applied in good time and got a reply to say I had been approved and now, two weeks later, nothing. ""They are all blaming each other - from the printers to Westminster, to the schools breaking up. It is gross inefficiency. ""I don't have any options now because I am going to be down in Surrey and won't be able to vote."" Earlier, First Minister John Swinney described the situation as ""deeply unacceptable"" and said he was not surprised the timing of election was causing problems. A number of Scottish councils have also reported delays in ballots being received by voters, including Fife and West Lothian. Perth and Kinross Council said on social media it felt ""a comprehensive review of capacity and systems is necessary after the election"". Royal Mail said it had investigated concerns over the delivery of postal votes in some areas but had found no backlogs in any of its offices in Scotland. Many councils have been sending out postal ballots in tranches, with people who applied after 7 June having to wait longer before the ballot packs are despatched."
Couple in 80s thrilled to be Glastonbury volunteers,"Oxfam said its work spans across various sectors of global emergency response, including womens rights, the climate crisis, food and water shortages, inequality and poverty. Last year, Glastonbury volunteers gave up more than 206,000 hours of their time over the summer and helped to raise more than £1.5m to support Oxfam's work.

Court orders drug dealer to hand over assets,"Rehman, of Hendford Drive, was linked to the operation by the National Crime Agency following the cracking of the Encrochat messaging system used by criminals. When he was arrested in February 2022 police were said to have seized almost £2,000 in cash as well as high-value watches. Despite having no income, the defendant had led a luxurious lifestyle with cars and expensive watches such as Rolexes, Leeds Crown Court previously heard. Judge Jonathan Gibson imposed the confiscation order in addition to a five-year serious crime prevention order which will come into force when Rehman is eventually released from prison. The order includes powers for the police to monitor Rehmans use of communication devices, the vehicles he has and where he is living. The judge said the order was not only desirable, but necessary to prevent, restrict or disrupt Rehmans involvement in any further serious crime.

Dad's death on day of baby's birth 'preventable',"A father-to-be who died on the day of his daughter's birth may have lived if a heart defect had not been missed, a coroner has found. Thomas Gibson, 40, died from a sudden cardiac arrest on 7 June 2023 after a hospital doctor ""misinterpreted"" a scan 11 days earlier, an inquest at Stockport Coroner's Court heard. The inquest was told that had medics at Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester given Mr Gibson a pacemaker he would still be alive. Coroner Christopher Morris concluded Mr Gibson died as a consequence of sudden cardiac death due to myocardial fibrosis. On the day Mr Gibson was due to become a father, his partner Rebecca Moss tried to rouse him as she prepared to go to hospital for an elective Caesarean. ""Wake up, it's baby day,"" she told him but found him ""stiff and cold"" and attempted emergency first aid until an ambulance arrived at their home in Stretford, Greater Manchester. He was declared dead and she gave birth to their daughter, Harper, the same day. At the end of the two-day inquest hearing, Mr Morris said: ""I can't even begin to fathom what that must have been like for her, particularly in the context of what should have been the happiest day for both of them."" He added: ""When the clinical team assessed him they did not appreciate the ECG showed him to be experiencing complete heart block. ""Had this been appreciated Mr Gibson would have been admitted under the care of cardiologists, a series of investigations undertaken, which would probably have culminated in an implantable device, such as a pacemaker being fitted. ""It is likely these measures would have avoided his death."" Speaking outside the court, Mr Gibson's partner Rebecca Moss said: ""The expertise which could have saved Tom's life was just one phone call away - I sincerely hope that there will be learnings from Tom's avoidable death. ""I am told that inquests aren't about blame but I have every right to be angry and to seek answers for Tom, Harper and our family."" Dr Mark Ainsley, clinical director of cardiology for the hospital trust, said if Mr Gibson's heart problem had been spotted on the ECG scan he would possibly have been monitored and treated there and then and fitted with a pacemaker, a procedure that takes ""less than an hour"", he said. The coroner asked: ""Do you think that sequence of events would likely have avoided his death?"" Dr Ainsley replied: ""I think the short duration between the ECG and his heart giving way, I think it's more than likely he would have avoided his death."" The inquest heard that Mr Gibson worked in a timber yard and was physically fit but had been suffering from a stomach bug, including cramps and diarrhoea, for about three weeks before his death. It culminated in him attending the A&E at Wythenshawe Hospital on May 27 last year. He was seen by Dr Oliver Handley, who recognised his ECG trace showed signs of an abnormality and referred it to a more senior medic, Dr Thomas Bull, the medical registrar, for a second opinion. Dr Bull said the ECG scan was likely to represent an abnormality he described as an intraventricular block, which is ""not an uncommon finding"" and not clinically ""significant"" without other heart-related symptoms. As there were no other heart-related symptoms he was discharged. But later analysis concluded the ECG identified a complete heart block, also known as a third-degree heart block, the most serious kind. Dr Matthew Thornber, a consultant at the hospital, said the two ECGs taken were not ""textbook"" examples of looking like a heart block condition and such diagnosis requires nuance and experience. ""This is not a barn door easy miss,"" he said. The coroner said he would be writing a prevention of future deaths report, addressed to the chief executive of the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence concerning clinical practice, around the interpretation of ECG scans. In a statement, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust said: ""We wish again to extend our condolences and sincere sympathies to Mr Gibson's family at this very difficult time. ""The trust has undertaken a thorough investigation to examine the circumstances following Mr Gibson's very sad death, and we apologise for where our care has fallen short of the high standards to which we aspire. ""We will be reviewing the coroner's conclusion carefully."" Listen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

Damage to new-build homes was 'sectarian hate crime',"Damage to two new-build properties in Antrim is being treated as a sectarian-motivated hate crime. Four people, dressed in dark clothing, threw objects in the Reford Grove development in the town at about 03:00 BST on Sunday, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said. On arrival, police officers noted that two windows had been smashed, and paint damage had been caused to both properties. One of the houses was occupied at the time, police said. Insp Parkes said the PSNI had increased ""proactive patrols"" in the area and the neighbourhood policing team would talk to community representatives ""to monitor any impact or concerns"". There is no place in our society for such behaviour.  We take a zero tolerance approach to those wanting to cause fear, or incite and promote hatred,"" Insp Parkes added. Police have appealed for information."
Dead Man Running: How mysterious punk band frontman became an international fugitive,"Earlier this year, a BBC documentary revealed how Avis managed to hide his crimes in plain sight, abusing women and children over decades, while creating a public image of a celebrated charity fundraiser in Inverness. The investigation also highlighted how the fugitive went by multiple names including Kem Avis, Kim Gordon and Cameron MacGregor right up to his capture in the US state of Colorado. The documentary had most of the story but there were still gaps - particularly about Aviss life before he appeared in Inverness in the 1990s. Avis told people he arrived in Inverness on horseback and that was all the folk of the Highland capital seemed to know. The day after the documentary aired an email arrived with BBC Scotlands Disclosure team from someone who had been active in the Suffolk punk music scene in the 1980s. It set the investigating journalists on a whole new path. The email read: As a teenage punk, the safest place to hang out in the very early 1980s was the market town of Bury St Edmunds. ""One of the most well-known characters in Bury was Vince Avis - he was never known as Kim. ""Having seen the monster that this man became I thought this information might interest you. The author was Paul Devine, formerly the bassist of punk band Cult of the Head in the 1980s. Avis, known only to them as Vince, was the bands frontman. I think the reason why we got so many people to come see us, apart from the fact we were brilliant, was [Aviss] presence because he was a legend, Paul said. He was a local hero in a way. Paul said Vince was one of the first punks in Bury St Edmunds and had attracted a group of loyal followers because of this status. A schoolmate and fan of the band, Sonja Vandersteen Pyett, remembers the younger Vince. I recall seeing him with a mohican, she said. ""That was the first Mohican I think I've ever seen. I just don't have any bad memories, and that's what's quite hard to figure out. Sonja had nothing but positive things to say about the teenager she knew, until she became aware of the documentary about his crimes in Inverness. She said: ""You just don't know what could have happened to the teenager I would have known because I don't know very much about his actual upbringing, his childhood. And who knows, maybe he always had a dark side."" With this new knowledge of where Kim Avis had come from, the focus of the podcast investigation moved to West Suffolk to see if anything more could be learned. There was no reference to ""Vince Avis"" in the local papers in the late 70s and early 80s. But there were a few hits for ""Kim Avis. In his late teens and early 20s, Avis was fined for drug possession and thefts. There were no articles relating to any serious sexual crimes in West Suffolk. Nothing that explained why Vince disappeared from West Suffolk and arrived in Inverness as Kim Avis. During our inquiries, one of Aviss old teachers from King Edward VI Grammar School in Bury St Edmunds got in touch. He remembered Vince as a character, a loner and a bit of a rebel. Another old friend, Andrew, told us he remembered a teenage Avis - though again he knew him as Vince - from the drug scene in the Bury St Edmunds area. There was this massive kind of drug scene going on just under the surface, a dark underbelly of this little town, he said. Just outside the town sits the house where Avis spent his late teenage years, one of two cottages on a property set among undulating fields. One house remains well looked after. The other is dilapidated and derelict. This is where Avis lived, seemingly on his own. Andrew would go to the house and experiment with drugs. He recalled one night where he and his girlfriend went round to Aviss cottage. We were having a laugh, you know, and then all of a sudden he turned, Andrew said. It's like, 'get out of my house, get out of here'. And he just had a look in his eyes that made me not want to argue. It was a very unpleasant experience to have somebody turn like that. I just really wasn't interested in going back there again afterwards. Andrew did see Vince one last time, about 10 years later in the early 1990s when he came back to Bury St Edmunds. Avis had been away - in Inverness. He had a broad Scottish accent, and I knew he wasn't Scottish, Andrew said. It seems there have been many different versions of Avis over the years. English, Scottish, punk singer, charity fundraiser, but for a large time a dangerous sexual predator. As for Paul Devine, the bandmate from Cult the Head, the last time he saw or heard from Avis was decades ago, when he saw him busking outside a branch of the old department store Woolworths. And then - nothing - until he heard of Kim Avis's crimes in the BBCs documentary. As uncomfortable as it is, I kind of felt a little bit protective towards the fellow, even though he's obviously a monster, Paul said. Something's obviously happened and I wonder whether this is a three-tier tale. You've got the tier that Sonja and I know, which is a bit of a berk - fascinating, magnetic, charismatic, talented. ""Then you got one of the most awful series of crimes imaginable. What the hell happened in the middle? Listen to Dead Man Running on BBC Sounds or wherever you get your podcasts. When eccentric Inverness street trader Kim Avis staged his own death in the waters off an infamous Californian beach five years ago, it sparked an international manhunt. Avis was eventually captured and brought to justice after the women he abused for years came forward to testify against him in court. A new podcast for BBC Sounds has uncovered the full strange and dark case of Avis, including his early days when he wasnt Kim and he wasnt in Inverness. Earlier this year, a BBC documentary revealed how Avis managed to hide his crimes in plain sight, abusing women and children over decades, while creating a public image of a celebrated charity fundraiser in Inverness. The investigation also highlighted how the fugitive went by multiple names including Kem Avis, Kim Gordon and Cameron MacGregor right up to his capture in the US state of Colorado.

Avis told people he arrived in Inverness on horseback and that was all the folk of the Highland capital seemed to know. The day after the documentary aired an email arrived with BBC Scotlands Disclosure team from someone who had been active in the Suffolk punk music scene in the 1980s. It set the investigating journalists on a whole new path. The email read: As a teenage punk, the safest place to hang out in the very early 1980s was the market town of Bury St Edmunds. ""One of the most well-known characters in Bury was Vince Avis - he was never known as Kim. ""Having seen the monster that this man became I thought this information might interest you. The author was Paul Devine, formerly the bassist of punk band Cult of the Head in the 1980s. Avis, known only to them as Vince, was the bands frontman. I think the reason why we got so many people to come see us, apart from the fact we were brilliant, was [Aviss] presence because he was a legend, Paul said. He was a local hero in a way. Paul said Vince was one of the first punks in Bury St Edmunds and had attracted a group of loyal followers because of this status. A schoolmate and fan of the band, Sonja Vandersteen Pyett, remembers the younger Vince. I recall seeing him with a mohican, she said. ""That was the first Mohican I think I've ever seen. I just don't have any bad memories, and that's what's quite hard to figure out. Sonja had nothing but positive things to say about the teenager she knew, until she became aware of the documentary about his crimes in Inverness. She said: ""You just don't know what could have happened to the teenager I would have known because I don't know very much about his actual upbringing, his childhood. And who knows, maybe he always had a dark side."" With this new knowledge of where Kim Avis had come from, the focus of the podcast investigation moved to West Suffolk to see if anything more could be learned. There was no reference to ""Vince Avis"" in the local papers in the late 70s and early 80s. But there were a few hits for ""Kim Avis. In his late teens and early 20s, Avis was fined for drug possession and thefts. There were no articles relating to any serious sexual crimes in West Suffolk. Nothing that explained why Vince disappeared from West Suffolk and arrived in Inverness as Kim Avis. During our inquiries, one of Aviss old teachers from King Edward VI Grammar School in Bury St Edmunds got in touch. He remembered Vince as a character, a loner and a bit of a rebel. Another old friend, Andrew, told us he remembered a teenage Avis - though again he knew him as Vince - from the drug scene in the Bury St Edmunds area. There was this massive kind of drug scene going on just under the surface, a dark underbelly of this little town, he said. Just outside the town sits the house where Avis spent his late teenage years, one of two cottages on a property set among undulating fields. One house remains well looked after. The other is dilapidated and derelict. This is where Avis lived, seemingly on his own. Andrew would go to the house and experiment with drugs. He recalled one night where he and his girlfriend went round to Aviss cottage. We were having a laugh, you know, and then all of a sudden he turned, Andrew said. It's like, 'get out of my house, get out of here'. And he just had a look in his eyes that made me not want to argue. It was a very unpleasant experience to have somebody turn like that. I just really wasn't interested in going back there again afterwards. Andrew did see Vince one last time, about 10 years later in the early 1990s when he came back to Bury St Edmunds. Avis had been away - in Inverness. He had a broad Scottish accent, and I knew he wasn't Scottish, Andrew said. It seems there have been many different versions of Avis over the years. English, Scottish, punk singer, charity fundraiser, but for a large time a dangerous sexual predator. As for Paul Devine, the bandmate from Cult the Head, the last time he saw or heard from Avis was decades ago, when he saw him busking outside a branch of the old department store Woolworths. And then - nothing - until he heard of Kim Avis's crimes in the BBCs documentary. As uncomfortable as it is, I kind of felt a little bit protective towards the fellow, even though he's obviously a monster, Paul said. Something's obviously happened and I wonder whether this is a three-tier tale. You've got the tier that Sonja and I know, which is a bit of a berk - fascinating, magnetic, charismatic, talented. ""Then you got one of the most awful series of crimes imaginable. What the hell happened in the middle? Listen to Dead Man Running on BBC Sounds or wherever you get your podcasts."

Derry to Dublin A5 road project tops £100m,"Officials from the Department for Infrastructure (DFI) also said a long-awaited decision on the A5 could be made ""towards the end of the summer"". ""There are still some outstanding elements but our intention is to put a series of papers to the executive over the summer with the view to a decision being taken later in the summer,"" Colin Hutchinson, the DFI's project director, told the committee. Fifty-seven people have died on the A5 since 2006, according to the department. Families who have lost loved ones on the road have called for Infrastructure Minister John O'Dowd to prioritise the upgrade. Officials told Stormont the planned upgrade would save lives. A public inquiry in 2023 heard arguments for and against the scheme, and its final report contained 30 recommendations. The committee was also told the infrastructure minister had not met representatives from the Alternative A5 Alliance, which has launched legal challenges against the scheme. But it was confirmed DFI officials had been in contact with the lobby group. The committee was also told the total cost of building the A5 currently stood at £1.7bn, with 600m (£508m) coming from the Irish government. The money spent on the A5 road project has now surpassed £100m, according to officials at the Department for Infrastructure. The 58-mile (85km) dual carriageway between Londonderry and the border at Aughnacloy was first announced in 2007, but has been beset by funding issues and legal challenges. Politicians on Stormont's infrastructure committee have been told it has already cost £110m even though construction work yet to begin. In 2021, the figure stood at just over £80m. BBC News NI has asked the department for a breakdown of the latest costs. Officials from the Department for Infrastructure (DFI) also said a long-awaited decision on the A5 could be made ""towards the end of the summer"".

Detectorist finds 'largest' gold nugget in England,"Mr Brock said he had only recently learned that it could be the biggest found in England, which was ""quite incredible really"", and he was going to split the proceeds with the landowner. An old track or road and a railway line are thought to have run through the farmland where the nugget was discovered, and the site contained stone understood to have originally come from Wales, said the auctioneers. On the day of the organised dig in May 2023, other people had up-to-date kit, said Mr Brock, while he ""bowled up with three old machines"", one of which immediately stopped working. His back-up detector, which had a faded screen, initially only flagged up a ""few rusty old tent pegs"", but within 20 minutes of scanning, the gold nugget was detected about five or six inches under the ground. ""I couldn't believe it,"" said the 67-year-old who first began metal detecting in 1989. ""I turned up late, was only there a matter of minutes and this treasure hunting expedition was supposed to last all day."" Ben Jones, from Telford-based auctioneers Mullock Jones, said: ""We've handled gold before but usually in the form of a ring, or jewellery or coins. But this is certainly a one-off for us."" The auction house said it was expecting ""considerable interest"". Bigger examples of gold nuggets have been found in Great Britain before, but they were in Wales and Scotland. ""The last one which claimed to be bigger in England was 54g but mine is 64.8g, so we're pretty confident it is the biggest found on English soil,"" said Mr Brock.

Meanwhile, a Murray Arbeid midnight blue strapless gown Princess Diana wore twice in 1986 and to a Royal Opera House performance of Cinderella in 1987 also topped its estimate. The gown sold for $780,000 (£617,000), almost four times its lower estimate.

A portion of the auction proceeds from this gown will benefit Muscular Dystrophy UK, alongside other specified lots. The auction also featured more than 20 handwritten letters, notes, and holiday cards from Princess Diana. Many of the letters were written to Maud Pendrey, a former housekeeper at the Spencer family home at the Althorp Estate in Northamptonshire, where Diana grew up. A three-page handwritten letter to Mrs Pendrey in 1984, written when Diana was pregnant with Harry, sold for nearly 15 times its estimate at $44,450 (£35,000). While a two-page handwritten letter to Mr and Mrs Pendrey from Diana in 1985, which featured reference photos of William and Harry. Diana signed the letter ""This comes with much love from the four of us"" - and it sold for $28,575 (£23,000). ""The phenomenal results of today's historic auction held just a few days before Princess Diana's birthday demonstrates why Diana is and always will remain one of the world's most beloved and inspiring cultural figures,"" Martin Nolan, co-founder and executive director of Julien's Auctions, said. ""These exquisite garments, shoes and accessories made not only fashion statements but also displayed her warmth and humanity that made Diana the most popular and greatest Royal style icon of all time."" The sale comes after a Jacques Azagury-designed dress worn by Diana in Italy in 1985 set a new world record for the most expensive dress worn by the royal at auction, selling for more than $1m (£792,000) in December. Previously, the most expensive dress worn by Princess Diana and sold at auction was a 1991 velvet gown by Victor Edelstein which sold for $604,800 (£476,437) in January."

Drivers who dodged fines with stolen ID sentenced,"A group of drivers who attempted to dodge motoring fines by using stolen ID details have been sentenced for the scam. Six men from West Yorkshire admitted perverting the course of justice by using the innocent Scottish woman's details, while another was found guilty after a trial. Police investigations uncovered 21 traffic offences by 12 vehicles which took place between 2019 and 2020 to be suspect. Rachel Wainwright, from West Yorkshire Police, said the victim, who had never even been to West Yorkshire, had suffered ""unwanted stress"". Most of the infractions were for speeding and all were attributed to the victim - who had no idea about the incidents. The drivers, from Bradford, Wakefield and Leeds, used the stolen ID when they filled out Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) forms. A vehicle's registered keeper completes the form to confirm who was driving a vehicle caught committing an offence. Speaking after six of the men were sentenced at Bradford Crown Court on Wednesday, Ms Wainwright said: ""They caused unwanted stress for an entirely innocent member of the public, but they have also had to face much more severe consequences for their actions by being hauled before the courts and sentenced for criminal offences. Those sentenced were: Abdul Kalam, 43, of New Fields Walk, Bradford, who admitted perverting the course of justice and was sentenced to three years and four months in prison. Kamran Ahmed, 43, of Wellands Terrace, Bradford, who admitted perverting the course of justice and was sentenced to two years and four months in prison. Alia Malik, 36, of Church Road, Normanton, in Wakefield, admitted perverting the course of justice and was sentenced to eight months in prison suspended for 18 months, while also being ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. Nasser Jahangir, 24, of Meadow Park Drive, Stanningley, Leeds, also admitted perverting the course of justice and was sentenced to six months in prison suspended for 18 months and ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work. Munsur Ali, 39, of Ashbourne Crescent, Bradford, admitted perverting the course of justice and was sentenced to eight months in prison suspended for 18 months and ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work. Meanwhile, Ayman Ahmed, 24, of Fairfield Road, Bradford, was found guilty of perverting the course of justice after a trial and was sentenced to two years in prison. A seventh person, Kanwal Ali, 34, of Upper Woodlands Road, Bradford, previously admitted perverting the course of justice and will be sentenced in September.

Drug addict who murdered woman for jewellery jailed,"A drug addict who murdered his friend to steal her jewellery, before hiding her body ""like rubbish"" under a sofa, has been jailed for at least 36 years. Glenna Siviter, 50, was stabbed 36 times at her home in Middlesbrough in December. Andrew Hall, 47, who was said to be like a ""brother"" to Ms Siviter, had denied murder but was found guilty at Newcastle Crown Court. Hall, who was also convicted of the attempted murder of a man and wounding with intent another man, was jailed for life with a minimum term. Prosecutors said Ms Siviter was killed at her home in Grimwood Avenue in the early hours of 11 December, with her body found four days later hidden beneath her sofa. In the days between the killing and discovery of her body, Hall also stabbed two other men after taking drugs with them. Jurors had been told Ms Siviter lived in Jersey for 20 years, but she fell back into drug use after returning to Middlesbrough. She and Hall had known each other since childhood and were ""like brother and sister"", Hall's partner told the trial. During the two and a half week-long trial, Peter Moulson KC said Ms Siviter was killed for her jewellery which was then sold or swapped for drugs. Hall, of Thorntree Avenue, Middlesbrough, had denied any wrongdoing but was found guilty after jurors spent a day and a half deliberating. Ms Siviter's son, Declan, who found her body, said his whole family had been ""devastated"" by his mother's death, and the ""disgustingly violent"" attack by Hall had caused a ""sickening whirlwind of emotion"". He said his mum had moved to Jersey to make a ""nice life for herself"", but she returned to Middlesbrough in 2017 after the death of her own mother. He said the subsequent death of a much-loved aunt led to Ms Siviter falling into drug use and ""mingling with the likes of Hall"". Mr Siviter said Hall's actions against a woman who knew and trusted him were ""horrific and despicable"", and his mum was ""hidden like rubbish"" beneath the sofa. ""Nobody should suffer such sickening acts of violence and be left to rot by someone who supposedly cared for her,"" Mr Siviter said, adding Hall was ""clearly a very dangerous individual who could turn incredibly violent"". Mr Siviter said his mum's murderer was a ""lying, manipulative, sneaky little rodent of a man"" who had stolen and sold Ms Siviter's belongings ""just for a rock of crack"". He said Hall had ""shown not one bit of remorse"" and implored the court to ""never let this man see the light of day again"". Prosecutor Peter Moulson KC said Hall murdered Ms Siviter ""for gain"" and ""the degree of violence was far beyond that which was necessary to achieve the defendant's ends"". He added there ""would have been a degree of pain and suffering before her death"". Craig Woodier, who was repeatedly stabbed in his car outside his Laycock Street home by Hall on 15 December, said the attempted murder had changed his life. He said he had to wear long shirts and hoods to cover his multiple scars and he could no longer trust anyone. Judge Mr Justice Lavender said Hall, who had multiple convictions for burglary and theft, launched ""unprovoked attacks"" on three of his acquaintances over five days in December. He said there was ""no discernible motive"" but the judge was sure drugs had played a ""significant role"" in Hall's actions. ""You ended Ms Siviter's life and brought grief and misery to the lives of others,"" the judge told him. Hall was also jailed for 25 years for the attempted murder and five years for wounding, both to be served concurrently. Det Ch Insp Peter Carr, from Cleveland Polices homicide team, paid tribute to Ms Siviter's family, adding they had shown ""great courage and dignity"" throughout the process. He said: ""Due to Halls denials, they have had to listen to the awful evidence in this case and hear about how Glenna was murdered in the family home."" He also thanked Hall's other victims for their bravery in attending court and ""reliving their ordeals as witnesses"". Follow BBC Tees on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

EU leaders to agree on top jobs despite Meloni discontent,"European leaders are due to announce their choices for the top jobs at the EUs helm at a two-day summit in Brussels, with current Commission president Ursula von der Leyen set to be nominated for a second mandate. The summit began with the signing of a security cooperation agreement between the EU and Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky also thanked EU leaders for opening membership negotiations with his country earlier this week. Other topics on the agenda included security and defence, with leaders from Poland and the Baltics asking the EU for funds to build a defence line along their border with Russia. But the more delicate issue of top jobs was left for last and is likely to be discussed at least into the evening. Earlier this week, it transpired that six EU leaders had reached a consensus on the names to put forward - each of them hailing from one of three parties that dominate the European Parliament. They are: The six EU leaders who negotiated the names also each represent the EPP, S&D or Renew. They were Greeces Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Polands Donald Tusk for the EPP, Spains Pedro Sánchez and Germanys Olaf Scholz for the socialists, and Frances Emmanuel Macron and the Netherlands Mark Rutte for Renew. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who heads the right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) bloc, was notably not included in the talks  despite the fact that the ECR has displaced Renew as the third largest group in the European Parliament following European elections earlier this month. Addressing the Italian parliament on Wednesday, Ms Meloni angrily said European voters had asked the EU to ""take a different path to the one it has travelled on so far"". Without naming names, she criticised ""those who argue that citizens are not mature enough to take certain decisions, and [who believe] that oligarchy is essentially the only acceptable form of democracy"". nan Earlier this week, Hungarys Viktor Orban also vented his displeasure at other EU leaders. Writing on X, Mr Orban said that the deal between the EPP, the S&D and the liberals ""ran against everything that the EU was based on"". ""Instead of inclusion, it sows the seeds of division,"" Mr Orban said, adding that EU top officials should represent ""every member state, not just leftists and liberals!"" On Thursday morning allies of Ms Meloni told reporters in Brussels that she had not yet decided whether she would endorse the new leadership team. However, even with Mr Orbans potential backing, Ms Meloni would not have the power to veto the top jobs nominations, as doing so would require bringing a majority of EU leaders on board. But Ms Meloni has gained a prominent status among European right-wingers, and Ms von der Leyen is unlikely to want to antagonise her at the start of a second mandate. Ahead of the summit, members of Ms von der Leyen's PPE group struck a conciliatory tone, with Polands Prime Minister Donald Tusk telling reporters: ""It's not Europe without Italy and there is no decision without PM Meloni, its obvious."" It is also thought that Italy will be offered a senior job in the next commission in exchange for an endorsement at todays summit. Each EU member state gets a commissioner, but some - like the economy or competition portfolios - are the most coveted. In a letter to EU leaders on the eve of the Brussels summit, Ms von der Leyen also promised to do more to address illegal migration, which is one of Ms Meloni's key concerns. If she is officially nominated as the EU leaders' candidate of choice for the presidency of the European Commission, Ms von der Leyen will then need to be approved by a majority of Members of the European Parliament at a session likely to take place in mid-July. Ms von der Leyen will be backed by the 190 members of her EPP group, but she will also need to secure support from other political groups to obtain a majority of 361. The S&D and Renew have said they would back Ms von der Leyen and - if all their MEPs do so - she will win the required majority. But the vote for European Commission president is secret, and some MEPs might not toe the party line. This means Ms von der Leyen could need votes from the ECR, which makes obtaining Ms Meloni's support all the more urgent."
EU says Georgia's membership path on hold over NGO law,"Georgia's path to EU membership has come to a standstill because of a controversial foreign influence law, European leaders said at a summit in Brussels. They said the law amounted to ""backsliding"" on Georgia's path to membership, ""de facto leading to a halt of the accession process"". Georgia was only granted EU candidate country status last December after being given a list of steps it needed to take to proceed, including justice reform. EU leaders meeting in Brussels expressed their ""steadfast solidarity with the Georgian people"" and called on the government in Tbilisi to reverse its ""current course of action"". European Union officials have strongly condemned Georgia's new foreign influence law, which was passed amid major anti-government protests and is due to come into effect next month. Opponents have dubbed it a ""Russian law because of its similarities with an existing law in Russia and believe the real reason for the legislation is to stifle dissent ahead of October's parliamentary elections. Under the law, media and non-governmental organisations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad will have to register as organisations acting in the interest of a foreign power, submit themselves to stringent audits, or face punitive fines. The Georgian government argues the rules will ensure transparency of money flowing to support NGOs and protect Georgia from foreign interference. But the EU's ambassador to Georgia, Pawel Herczynski, said last week that Tbilisi and the European Union were going through a difficult period. ""The adoption of this law, as I see it, froze Georgia's integration into the European Union,"" he said according to Georgia's Interpress news agency. The US has previously said the law threatens free speech. Thousands of Georgians have taken the streets in recent weeks to oppose the measure and there have been reports of NGO workers, activists and opposition politicians receiving threats or being physically assaulted at rallies. EU leaders on Thursday also called for an end to ""the increasing acts of intimidation, threats and physical assaults against civil society representatives, political leaders, civil activists and journalists"". They said they would continue to monitor the situation in Georgia closely and called on the government to ensure the upcoming elections were ""free and fair""."

EasyJet launches new routes from City of Derry,"Ali Gayward, easyJet's UK country manager, said the airline was ""delighted"" to announce the launch from City of Derry airport for the first time this winter. ""We are proud to be the largest airline in Northern Ireland and by expanding our network we are providing our customers in Northern Ireland even greater choice and UK connectivity, all with great value fares and friendly service, and we look forward to welcoming them on board,"" she added. City of Derry Airport's managing director Steve Frazer said it is anextremely significant step forward for the airport and the wider north west region. He said these flight routes will be a key economic driver for business investment in the north west and inbound travel and tourism. This is an operator [easyJet] that has never operated at the airport before and this fills routes that we have been looking to fill for about three or four years. With easyJet, this has taken about three years to make this happen. The airport's head of business development, Brenda Morgan MBE, said the new flights will offer connectivity to two key UK airport hubs. ""Services to Edinburgh and Liverpool have been in demand from both corporate and leisure travellers in the north west,"" she said. ""The flight schedule for Mondays and Fridays provides fantastic timings for business travel during the week and weekend breaks for the leisure market. President of Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, Greg McCann, said the news was ""hugely welcome."" He said it ""delivers upon the expansion of connectivity that the North West region has long needed."" ""We look forward to the economic benefits these services will bring and to City of Derry Airport further expanding its offering through further moves,"" he added. In January, Derry City and Strabane District Council warned that money from Stormont to help secure City of Derry Airport's long-term future was unlikely this year. The airport is owned by the council and it costs ratepayers £3.45m to help pay operational costs. Previously, the council said they were facing a funding shortfall of about £729,000 for the next financial year. Mr Frazer told BBC Radio Foyle on Thursday they also expect a decision regarding long-term future funding for the airport in the coming weeks. ""I have been involved in the talks and everyone can see the rationale,"" he said. ""Everyone can see the council and the rate payers of Derry City and Strabane have funded the airport for a long period and that needs to shift to central government where the benefits of the whole north west in having the airport and the growth of the region can be achieved.

Emerging artists take over flagship arts venue,"Up-and-coming artists are being given the chance to show off their work in a £240m flagship arts venue described as ""one of the most unique places this side of the Atlantic"". Two Manchester-based artist collectives will be given free rein of the city's Aviva Studios ""to play, and think big!"" The Artist Takeovers events are the brainchild of Factory International, which operates the vast Aviva Studios warehouse in Water Street. Artist development manager Punam Ramchurn said it was an ""opportunity to experiment"", and part of the organisation's remit to support emerging talent. Both collectives have been offered up to £10,000 to cover expenses such as artists' fees and production costs. They will also receive practical advice from experts on how to display their work in the vast space. British-Bolivian theatre-maker Jenny Jackson is taking part in the first takeover, alongside theatre designer Rosie Elnile and Glasgow-based artist Craig McCorquodale. The trio have created an amphitheatre from clay inside the warehouse at the Aviva Studios. Jenny said the group are ""conjuring this idea of a gladiatorial arena or a market square"". ""We're inviting 250 local people to come in and interact with the structure,"" she explained. ""We've got cheerleaders, we've got a football team, a brass band and a police male voice choir"". Jenny, who moved to Manchester in 2018, said the project chimes with her adopted city's proud sense of identity. ""Manchester feels like a city with a strong cultural identity, and it has a really strong sense of community. It feels right that it's here."" The £240m Aviva Studios, which opened in 2023, is the largest arts project to open in the UK since the Tate Modern in London. This summer's Takeover initiative aims to give artists the freedom to create original work in a way that is not possible in other spaces. ""Every week I see about five artists because they want to get in the door,"" said Ms Ramchurn. ""The Aviva Studios is probably the most unique place on this side of the Atlantic, and its great to see artists at different levels get the opportunity to show off their work and get more commissions in future"". Factory International also runs a creative learning programme for secondary school pupils across Greater Manchester. Over the past year, more than 180 young people from five schools across the region have taken part in creative workshops, watched shows and seen their artwork showcased at the studios.

The chick, whose gender is not yet known, was born two weeks ago to six-year-old mum Janine and eight-year-old dad Kevin, who have lived at the site near Warminster, Wiltshire, since 2018. The birds, who are of the Sagittarius Serpentarius species, are normally found across Sub-Saharan Africa and are known for hunting snakes and reptiles. Leader keeper lakes and birds Matt Hardy said it was ""exciting to have a successful hatch of an endangered species"", and hopes it will allow the park to ""create a new breeding programme in the future"". We are providing extra smaller food items for the parents to give to the chick and as secretary birds can be very protective of their nests and chicks, we are ensuring they have as much space and peace and quiet as possible, he added.

England stars who hail from same grassroots patch,"Coaches who helped three footballers become England stars said it is no surprise that they all come from the same area. They said grassroots football was massive in close proximity in Greater Manchester, where Phil Foden, Kobbie Mainoo and Cole Palmer all grew up. ""Kids are playing football here all the time, it's really on the up,"" said Palmer's first coach Graeme Folwer. All three are in England's Euros 2024 squad. Mr Fowler said there were ""loads of teams, leagues, and untapped talent"" in places like Wythenshawe and Stockport. Palmer, 22, who scored 22 goals in the Premier League for Chelsea this season after leaving Manchester City last year, started out playing for NJ Wythenshawe. He was a pupil at Gateley Primary School and at an early age his technical ability turned heads. In his first training session aged five, Palmer ""stood out by a mile"", Mr Fowler said. ""He was just running with a ball, and kids were just chasing him and they couldnt get the ball of him, he was brilliant."" The coach oversaw Palmer's development in the years to come and said it was not long before ""every single scout in the North West was after him"". ""His biggest thing is the mentality, he always wanted to be a footballer, and he was determined, out practising every day.  Thats the difference really,"" Mr Fowler said. A boyhood Manchester United fan, Palmer ended up joining Manchester City's youth academy and making his senior team debut in 2020. His determination was developed at a very young age when he was taken down to Hollyhedge Park by his dad to kick a ball about, his uncle Steve Palmer said. ""We are really proud, hes a Wythenshawe lad"". Not far from Wythenshawe, Manchester United's breakthrough star of the season Mainoo was five when he started playing for Cheadle & Gatley Junior Football Club in Stockport. ""He came into our indoor facility on a Sunday morning and literally in the first couple of weeks, we though wow, what a player"", youth coach Steve Vare told BBC Radio Manchester. ""He was only small, which sounds daft to say, but you could just see that he was just unbelievably skilful, and just had the ability to go past players for fun. ""It got to the point where I was loading all my best players in the opposing team just to try and make it a challenge for him. ""And even then he would single-handedly win the game."" The midfielder went on to join Manchester United at nine. He earned his place in the England Euros 2024 squad at 19 on the back of his successful season with the club. Mr Vare said Mainoo is an inspiration ""to all the kids, not just within Cheadle & Gatley, but within grassroots football"". ""The moral of this story for kids out there is if you're good enough and you want to go professional, then why not."" Palmer and Mainoo's success is similar to Manchester City's Foden, who grew up in Stockport and joined the club's academy aged four. The 24-year-old is tipped to play a major role at Euro 2024, having enjoyed his highest-scoring season with the club. England begin their Euro 2024 campaign against Serbia in Gelsenkirchen on Sunday. The games are being shown across Greater Manchester, including at Palmer's youth team NJ Wythenshawe's clubhouse. ""The atmosphere is going to be electric, especially if Cole gets on,"" Mr Fowler said. Listen to the best of BBC Radio Manchester on Sounds and follow BBC Manchester on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Evan Gershkovich in court as spy trial starts in Russia,"The list of US citizens currently in prison in Russia includes former marine Paul Whelan. In 2020 he was convicted of espionage and sentenced to 16 years in a penal colony. Mr Whelan vehemently denies having committed any crime. Last year, Alsu Kurmasheva - a journalist with Prague-based Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) - was arrested in Russia. Ms Kurmasheva holds American and Russian passports. On a trip home to visit her ailing mother, she was detained. She was charged with spreading false information about the Russian armed forces over a book she had helped to edit which contains criticism of Russias invasion of Ukraine. If convicted, she could face up to 15 years in prison. Among the other Americans behind bars in Russia are: When he has spoken publicly about the case of Mr Gershkovich, Russian President Vladimir Putin has indicated he is open to the idea of a prisoner swap. There have been contacts between the US and Russia. But whom does the Kremlin want in exchange? President Putin has not named names. But he has dropped a strong hint. When asked about Mr Gershkovich a few months ago, the Russian president alluded to the case of Vadim Krasikov. Believed to be a Russian agent, Mr Krasikov is currently serving a life sentence for murder in Germany. Its evident that this is hostage diplomacy, says Deborah Ball. The Russians have been perfectly plain about what their objective is. Putin has barely hidden the fact that he wants to trade Evan and regards him as a pawn. Hes a political hostage. The Kremlin knows that America makes deals to get its citizens back. In 2022, the US authorities released a convicted Russians arms dealer, Viktor Bout, to secure freedom for Brittney Griner. The American basketball star had been jailed in Russia on drug charges. Now an American journalist is in the dock. The Kremlin declined to comment on talks over a possible prisoner swap deal with the US. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that he could not go into detail and that the topic should not be publicly discussed. ""The investigation is under way, the trial is under way, so here we just need to wait for the verdict that will be delivered,"" he said. It is unclear how long the trial of Evan Gershkovich will last and how much longer the US reporter will be in a Russian prison. Its impossible for us to read this. We just dont know, were shooting in the dark, says Ms Ball. The Russians regard this process, this sham trial, as part of some process they envision. Where it fits into what happens next, we have absolutely no idea."

Ex-military air crews sue government over fumes,"Speaking to BBC Radio Somerset, Jonathan Dingle from law firm Normanton Chambers in Taunton - which is representing some of those claimants - said: ""For many years, the fumes coming out of the gnome engines which sit on top of the Sea King helicopter or on the front of the Wessex helicopter, pumped out benzine carcinogens - things that cause cancer. ""These recirculated through the body of the helicopters causing - we believe - cancers to grow in all sorts of parts of the body of these aircrew that wouldn't be there at the age you'd expect. ""People in their late 30s or early 40s were coming forward with all sorts of devastating cancers - some lost their lives."" Mr Dingle added that he believes the issue does not just affect personnel once based at the Royal Navy base in Yeovilton in Somerset, but also people at Newquay and Helston in Cornwall, and others in the RAF. He said the Wessex helicopter was designed and launched in 1958 and the Sea King in 1968, both with exhausts that pumped out fumes into the area just below their rotor blades. ""Those forced the gases down and circulated through... they [the crews] were breathing in these exhaust gases."" Mr Dingle said since the story of this legal action was broken by the The Times, ""another dozen or so people"" have come forward. ""These are people who are dying, unnecessarily... people who have given their lives to the service of this nation,"" he added. A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: ""We hugely value our service personnel and veterans and owe a debt of gratitude to all those who serve, often with great personal sacrifice. ""We continually review our policies to ensure they are aligned with good practice and protect our people from harm. ""Service personnel and veterans who believe they have suffered ill health due to service, from 6 April 2005, have the existing and long-standing right to apply for no-fault compensation under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme.""

Former servicemen from Somerset and Wiltshire are among those suing the government over claims they developed cancer as a result of toxic fumes breathed in while they were working. Lawyers acting for the personnel claim the fumes from helicopters were circulated in the cabins of the helicopters themselves and ingested by their crews. It is believed more than 40 people are taking legal action, according to The Times newspaper, but one of the lawyers involved said the number affected could be much higher. The Ministry of Defence said former personnel can apply for compensation if they believe their ill health is a result of their time in the military.

Expert solves mystery of WW2 wall engraving,"""Finding the stories behind it has been wonderful,"" he added. ""This has been the highlight of my research."" The carving was first spotted by Ms Sheppard when she was walking back from work. ""I'm naturally curious and the word 'Texas' caught my eye, and I thought 'what are the chances of that being in Westbury-on-Trym?',"" she said. Two years later, Ms Sheppard spotted a piece written by Mr Davey about 'Yanks in Bristol', and she sent him the pictures of what she had found. ""It was really exciting to receive the photos,"" Mr Davey said. ""I cycled down to see the bricks and Hillsboro Texas stood out because it's such a small place. ""There's only about 10,000 people [who lived there] so I thought there might be a better chance of finding out who was actually responsible for the graffiti. ""I tried to contact a local paper in Hillsboro - they were really interested and ran a story on it but we got no response from that."" Hitting a dead-end, the Western Daily Press ran the story which was spotted by Paul Atwell, the son of Jackie Atwell, who had dated a GI from Hillsboro during the war. Mr Atwell then looked through his mother's photograph collection. ""She produced this photo of her and this American GI who she'd had a friendship with and went on a couple of dates with - he was from Hillsboro,"" he said. ""I said to mum 'isn't that where that chap comes from on the photo?'"" Mr Browning had been living with a family on Falcondale Road, near to where the inscription was found. ""I think they got on very well - they went to the zoo one day and then went up to a fair on the Downs one day in the bumper cars and had a good time,"" Mr Atwell added. After being contacted by the Atwells, Mr Davey began researching Mr Browning and discovered he worked at a department store before he was drafted.

Falcon puppets join city's annual pilgrimage,"""The word 'peregrine' itself means 'pilgrim', so it is only right that they should feature with the thousands of other pilgrims who will be with us for this great celebration."" The birds of prey have returned to the St Albans nesting site for the third year in a row. More than 375,000 people watched the falcon's eggs hatch on an online live stream in 2023. Alban was a citizen of Verulamium, the third-largest city in Roman Britain, who died for his faith in about AD300, near the spot where St Albans Cathedral now stands, after giving shelter to a Christian priest.

Family's pride at Wakenshaw gun's new home,"Grandson Mark Wakenshaw said: ""Mersa Matruh was a battle in the run-up to El Alamein, where my granddad is buried. ""We have visited, but now we have somewhere closer to home where we can come to remember him. Its like a gravestone for us."" Pte Wakenshaw was fatally wounded in the battle, but his bravery prevented the enemy from attacking a nearby infantry company and allowed them to withdraw to safety. After his death aged 28, he was awarded the Victoria Cross - the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry that British and Commonwealth forces can receive. The Wakenshaw gun was moved from its former home at Sevenhills in Spennymoor to The Story, ahead of the venue opening on 14 June. Mr Wakenshaw added: ""This is where the gun should be, a place where the wider public can come to learn about the sacrifices of the lads of the DLI so we can prevent what happened then from ever happening again."" Col Ted Shields, chair of trustees of the DLI, added the Wakenshaw Gun helped people connect to those who served in the regiment.

Fashion giant Shein closer to London listing,"A company wishing to sell its shares in the UK must first apply to the FCA for a prospectus containing detailed financial information to be approved. The filing of papers is the first stage of that process and brings the company a step closer to a listing in the UK  selling shares in the business on the London Stock Exchange  but doesn't necessarily mean it will end up listing there. In fact, it was initially thought that a listing in the US was the most likely route for Shein after the firm filed papers there late last year, but the move came under close scrutiny from both Republican and Democrat politicians amid concerns about the companys close links to China. Earlier in June, Marco Rubio, a leading Republican on the US Senate Intelligence Committee, and an ally of Donald Trump, wrote to UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt warning him about ""grave ethics concerns"" and Sheins ""deep ties to the Peoples Republic of China"". Slave labor, sweat shops, and trade tricks are the dirty secrets behind SHEINs success, Mr Rubio wrote in his letter to Mr Hunt. The United Kingdom has a storied tradition of abolitionism, from Wilberforce and Cowper to the Modern Slavery Act in our day. I trust you will treat these allegations against SHEIN with the utmost seriousness, investigate them fully, and take appropriate action to protect investors, he added. A spokesperson for the company said: ""SHEIN has a zero-tolerance policy for forced labour and we are committed to respecting human rights. We take visibility across our entire supply chain seriously and we require our contract manufacturers to only source cotton from approved regions."" UK MPs have also expressed concern, but Labours shadow business secretary Jonathan Reynolds indicated on Monday that he would welcome Shein listing its shares in London, as it would open the company up to closer scrutiny. In a business election debate, hosted by Bloomberg, Mr Reynolds said he had met representatives from the company. My view on any business of this sort is that if theyre doing business in the UK, we should ideally seek to regulate them from the UK. The kind of expectations we would have, whether that is on labour market or regulatory compliance, or tax - that is best done from them being based in the UK. So if a listing was to be considered, I would want that, because I would know that is the way we can enforce the high standards we would expect, he added. His opponent in the debate, the Conservative Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch, said she had concerns over a potential listing but added: It doesnt mean we dont want them. Admitting that she was yet to meet anyone from the company, Ms Badenoch said one concern was around Sheins business model of sending smaller packages direct to customers in the UK. Under customs rules, duties are not paid on goods under £135 and she said that could mean quite a lot lost in terms of taxes for the government. Ms Badenoch also said she would ""want to look at"" allegations around forced labor. The City is regulated and we have regulators that do that. Im talking specifically about this business and what wed want to see. We dont want a situation where the business secretary is interfering in every single listing but those are my specific problems with Shein, Ms Badenoch said. Some parts of the fashion sector in the UK have also urged caution. The British Fashion Council (BFC), which represents companies such as Burberry and Mulberry, said a stock exchange listing for Shein would be of significant concern to UK fashion designers and retailers. Fashion businesses, including Shein, must embrace corporate due diligence in their supply chains. The BFC would encourage the UK government, the Financial Conduct Authority and the London Stock Exchange to ensure that any business listing in London is an active, responsible leader in this regard and is able to evidence addressing compliance and sustainability concerns in all areas, from worker treatment to material sourcing to citizen engagement in disposable fashion, said Caroline Rush, the chief executive of the BFC. Despite the criticism, a potential Shein listing would be seen by many as a big boost for London, which has seen a number of high-profile companies leave the city for the US. In an interview with the BBC last month, the head of the London Stock Exchange, Julia Hoggett, said the move would ensure the company became more transparent. Any company that wishes to put itself through the scrutiny of being on public markets - that is the opportunity for them to raise the bar in the way that they approach their corporate governance and the way they approach investors, and I think that is very much the value that public markets have, she said."
Father praises football club after son's death,"""He was so excited, he got pictures with all the players. The icing on the cake was wearing the winner's medal,"" Mr Ahmed said. ""Everyone was so, so lovely to him.""

Zayan was thrilled when at one game defender Matthias Curley came over to chat to them, Mr Ahmed said. ""He was sensitive but also loved to get on the dance floor and wasn't shy, he loved socialising,"" he added. He would light up the room when he walked in. He got on with everyone and was the sweetest, sweetest boy. Paying tribute, the club said on social media Zayan was ""a massive Tamworth fan"".

Fears for British businessman kidnapped in Ecuador,"However, it did not name Mr Armstrong as the man involved. A Foreign Office spokesperson added that its staff were supporting the man's family. A spokeswoman for Forbidden Corner, a folly garden created by Mr Armstrong at his 500-acre Tupgill Park estate in North Yorkshire, told the BBC they were aware of the reports from Ecuador. But they said they did not currently have any further information about what had happened. She said: ""The thoughts and prayers of everyone at Forbidden Corner are with the Armstrong family."" According to local media in Ecuador, Mr Armstrong was kidnapped at dawn on Saturday at a farm he owned in Baba in Los Rios province. As many as 15 men entered the property dressed as police officers and took him away, reports suggested. It was also reported that a Colombian woman, Katherine Paola Santos, who was believed to be Mr Armstrong's partner, was kidnapped at the same time. There were no immediate details about the captors, the AFP news agency reported. In the lower reaches of Wensleydale in North Yorkshire, there are few businesses better known than Forbidden Corner. It is a beautiful garden with surprise water jets and hidden caves which has delighted children for years. It was built by Colin Armstrong in the grounds of his home and is a very popular tourist attraction. Mr Armstrong is very well known locally, but not often seen, as he spends most of his time managing his large agricultural business in Ecuador - something he has done for decades. He does return to the UK at times and was back here entertaining  a group of Ecuadoreans earlier this year. He is popular with his staff, who are visibly concerned about the situation in Ecuador - although they know little more than what has been said by the authorities there. A message from the Ecuadorean police on X, formerly Twitter, said officers were carrying out ""operational and investigative work"" in connection with the case. The Ecuadoran Foreign Ministry has not yet commented. Mr Armstrong was awarded the OBE and Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George for services to the British Monarchy in 2011. He was a former UK honorary consul to Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, a voluntary role which involved supporting British interests and providing support to British nationals who found themselves in difficulty. Kidnappings for ransom and robberies have become common in parts of Ecuador, including Guayaquil and its outskirts. Most of the violence is attributed to the increasing involvement of local gangs with rival Mexican drug cartels."

Female pilot inspiring others in male-dominated job,"For Ms Newton, it was an easy career decision due to her family's ""strong aviation"" links. ""My dad is also an easyJet captain and I have been privileged enough to be able to fly with him a few times, which was honestly fantastic,"" she said. ""My grandfather was in the RAF and my great-grandfather flew in World War One and World War Two."" First officers are paid between £48,000 to £86,000 per year, while captains can earn up to £173,000 annually. Despite the lucrative wage, it is still a career that many women do not train for. ""There is a lot of information online and a couple of highly regarded flying schools that are UK-based,"" Ms Newton added. ""Once youve got the technical foundations, youll be surprised to hear that a large part of the day-to-day challenges in this job involve team work and managing people, rather than pulling big hydraulic levers or engineering."" Since joining the airline ten years ago, she said ""perceptions are changing"" when it comes to women working in the currently male-dominated industry. ""The technical job is the same regardless of your gender and perceptions are changing, but we know this takes time which is why it remains important to keep a focus on it,"" she added. ""Im really proud to be female pilot and also really proud of the hard work going on behind the scenes at easyJet to make the pathway into aviation more accessible for everyone."" The airline is recruiting 1,000 new pilots by 2028 as part of a five-year drive, with an  aim of increasing its numbers of women pilots. Bosses have launched a pilot school visits programme and Summer Flight School to attract more women to the career. About 7.5% of easyJets pilots in the UK are women compared to the UK industry average of 6.5%, with around 300 women, including 99 captains, now flying for the airline.

Film festival focuses on South Asian cinema,"Featuring six films in its line-up, both the Bradford Alhambra Studio and the Hyde Park Picture House in Leeds are involved in the festival. Films being shown include Toronto International Film Festival winner Sthal (A Match), which is a debut feature for director Jayant Digambar Somalkar. According to organisers, it chronicles ""the journey of a young woman striving for an education and a brighter future in a patriarchal society, where arranged marriage is presented as the only option for self-betterment"". Meanwhile, the world premiere of director Haider Zafar's Before Nikkah will take place at the Bradford Alhambra Studio. Set in London, it follows two British Pakistanis who go on a blind date as they prepare for a prospective arranged marriage. Tight: The World of Indian Bodybuilding, a documentary directed by Elliott Gonzo, is also being screened. It follows a young bodybuilder from South India and his preparations to be crowned ""Mr India"". The films would be in English, Marathi, Urdu, Kannada and Tamil, organisers said. Mr Sawhney said it was important to show films that were in ""home languages, not just Hindi"". He added that he wanted to bring a diverse range of film to places beyond London. ""The passion is to bring South Asian Cinema, which isn't Bollywood. ""We picked films that show realistic images of South Asia today - they're not glamourised."" The aim was to ""celebrate India and all the neighbouring countries, showing the best of South Asian independent cinema"", Mr Sawhney said.

Final chapter for library in working phone box,"Posting on social media, one of the organisers, said: ""Unfortunately, the village generosity has got the better of us."" ""The BT poster has gone on today, so if you recently donated any books you may wish to remove."" BT said the phone box needed to be kept clear for people to make calls and for engineers to carry out tests and repairs. Colin Goodwin, the chairman of the parish council, said the library had been very popular with ""more and more books going in"". The parish council had tried to adopt the phone box as part of a project run by BT, he added. However, due to poor network coverage in the village, BT had ""insisted"" that the phone box remained. ""They have now slapped a sticker on it, so we are not allowed to use it any more,"" Mr Goodwin said. While it was a shame to see the library go, he appreciated the reasons given on the notice. ""We are now looking for alternatives  hopefully we will find somewhere suitable,"" he said. Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

Firm fined for selling China-made cars as Italian,"The Italian government has fined a car company $6.4m (£5m) for allegedly branding vehicles that were made in China as being produced in Italy. DR Automobiles misleadingly marketed cars as being produced in Italy, even though they were mostly made in China, according to the country's competition regulator. The firm said it would appeal against the fine as it had never claimed its vehicles were completely made in Italy. Southern Italy-based DR Automobiles assembles low-cost vehicles, using components produced by Chinese car makers Chery, BAIC and JAC. The regulator said cars under the company's DR and EVO brands were sold as being Italian-made but were largely of Chinese origin. Only minor assembly and finishing work was carried out in Italy, it said. ""This practice has coincided with a period in which the company recorded marked growth in sales of DR and EVO vehicles in the Italian market,"" the authority added. The move comes as Italy and the European Union (EU) as a whole are cracking down on cars produced outside the trading bloc. Last month, dozens of Morocco-made Fiat Topolinos were seized in the Italian port of Livorno because they had Italian flag insignia. Fiat's parent company Stellantis said it had followed regulations but has since removed the flags from the vehicles. Last week, the EU threatened to hit Chinese electric vehicles with import taxes of up to 38%, after politicians called them a threat to the region's motor industry. These charges would come on top of the current rate of 10% levied on all Chinese electric car imports to the EU. In response, China said the tariffs violated international trade rules and described the investigation as ""protectionism"". The announcement came after the US last month raised its tariff on Chinese electric cars from 25% to 100%."
Firms fined for worker's 35ft lift fall,"Two companies have been fined after an electrician fell 35ft (10m) head first when a crane knocked him out of his lift cage. The worker was repairing light fittings at Expert Tooling and Automation Ltd in Coventry when he was knocked out of his scissor lift cage by a crane being operated by another worker nearby. The 52-year-old from Sheffield fell onto the factory floor leaving him with a fractured skull and many other injuries. His employer, Optilight Electrical Services Ltd, and Expert Tooling and Automation admitted breaches of health and safety laws and were fined £7,000 and £50,000 respectively. The worker operating the overhead crane on 21 September 2022 did not see the electrician in the lift and the collision caused it to twist and hit nearby racking before landing on the factory floor, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), who prosecuted the firms, said. A second employee from Optilight Electrical Services narrowly avoided being crushed by the scissor lift, jumping out of the way before it landed on the floor, the HSE added. The electrician sustained a fractured skull, two brain bleeds, a broken collarbone, eight broken ribs, a broken elbow and wrist as well as a punctured lung. He was later placed in an induced coma and underwent several operations. The HSE found Optilight Electrical Services had not identified the operation of overhead cranes as a risk to its employees working at height at Expert Tooling and Automation's site on Sayer Drive. Expert Tooling and Automation did not put procedures in place to prevent the use of overhead cranes while the work was taking place and relied on contractors identifying risks and implementing measures. Both companies did not communicate with each other about how the work they were undertaking could impact safety, the HSE added. Expert Tooling and Automation pleaded guilty to breaching Section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work Act and Optilight Electrical Services Limited, of Oakwood Road, Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, admitted breaching Section 2. Both firms were also ordered by magistrates in Birmingham to pay £1,985 in costs at the hearing on 29 April. HSE inspector Charlotte Cunniffe said: This case clearly illustrates the disastrous consequences that can occur when two companies each assume the other has taken responsibility for safe working practices.  Risk often arises through a failure to communicate effectively. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, X and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk"

Florida man in critical condition after shark attack,"A ""severe bite"" from a shark in East Florida on Friday has left a man in critical condition from blood loss, authorities said. The Nassau County Sheriffs Office Marine Unit said they found the man on a boat. He was losing a lot of blood from a critical injury to his forearm. Acting swiftly, a deputy boarded the vessel and applied a tourniquet to stop the bleeding, the sheriffs office said. An official then commandeered the watercraft and took the man to a boat ramp, where local fire rescue officials were waiting. The victim was airlifted to hospital and remains in critical condition, the sheriff's office said. He is expected to recover. The man was aboard a boat on the east coast of Florida when the shark attack occurred, officials said. The incident comes on the heels of two separate shark attacks that injured three swimmers in the Gulf Coast of Florida earlier in June. One of the women had part of her arm amputated after being bitten in Walton County in north-west Florida. Along with the amputation she suffered ""critical injuries"" to her hip, officials said. At another beach just miles away and on the same day, two teenage girls were attacked while in the water.

Fly-tipping crackdown launched,"A new campaign to crack down on fly-tipping has been launched in Greater Manchester. Town hall chiefs said illegal dumping of rubbish costs Trafford Council tens of thousands of pounds to clean up and leaves neighbourhoods looking a mess. From January to April 2024, almost 100 tonnes of fly-tipped household and commercial waste was removed in the borough by the One Trafford Partnership. Many of the items dumped could have been recycled, donated or even sold as second-hand, the council said. Waste dumped by traders also made up a proportion of rubbish removed. Residents are being urged to make sure to know exactly where their waste goes if they pay someone to remove it. They can check this by asking waste removal companies for a valid waste licence. People who fly-tip could face anything from a £400 fixed penalty notice up to a £50,000 fine. Council officials said there were lots of options available for everyone to remove or rehome unwanted items. The One Trafford Partnership, a collaboration between Trafford Council and its contractor Amey, has a bulky waste collection service that will collect up to five items for £40. ""Its everyone's responsibility to dispose and recycle unwanted items properly,"" a council spokesman said.

Force checks senior officers after chief's sacking,"Acting Chief Constable Ivan Balhatchet said chief superintendents and above would be ""subject to more stringent checks"" and any declared military service and university qualifications would also be scrutinised. The OPFCC said the process in relation to the force's eight senior officers serving in those roles had already begun. It added a review was under way into the checks carried out into Mr Adderley prior to his appointment in June 2018. ""This will look at the level, nature and robustness of vetting and other checks into any information that was provided in support of his appointment,"" the office said.

No records existed supporting any commendation and he had never achieved any rank above Able Seaman. He also claimed to have attended officer training at the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth between 1982 and 1986, but again this was untrue.

He explained: ""We need to look after ourselves a lot more. ""The more we promote discussions about poor mental health, the more people will discuss it, the more people will get help and the more people will be saved.""

""Kyron was more than my son, he was my rock, my biggest supporter and he made me proud to be his mother,"" Ms Lesner said. Mr Lee's dad Stephen Lee described his son's death as ""senseless"". ""Kyron was such a positive, genuine man who, when things werent going well around him, made the most of life and went out of his way to help others,"" he said. ""I will never understand how it can be so easy to take a life, and destroy the lives of others too. I have not heard a single explanation as to why my son died that day."" Det Ch Insp Mike Roddy, of Thames Valley Police, said: ""There was a history of violence between this group of males and another group. It is clear to me that they intended to cause serious harm that evening. ""They utilised a stolen car, armed themselves with weapons, used clothing to mask their identities, took steps to distance themselves from the vehicle and attempted to avoid prosecution. A force spokesperson confirmed Ilias Almallah, 22, of Eltham Avenue, Slough, was also found guilty of murder in March and Mohamed Abdulle, 21, of Kenbury Drive, Slough, previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to causing grievous bodily harm with intent. They will be sentenced on 19 July. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram. Send your story ideas to south.newsonline@bbc.co.uk or via WhatsApp on 0808 100 2240."
Four schoolboys appear in court over Limavady fire,"All four defendants are charged with burglary of the property and intent to cause unlawful damage in relation to the blaze. Two of the 12-year-old boys are also charged with arson intending to damage such property or being reckless as to whether such property would be damaged and intending thereby to endanger the safety and lives of the residents. One of them is further charged with an offence of burglary with intent to steal. The fire was eventually brought under control in the early hours of Friday 31 May. The area was later evacuated after asbestos was discovered by experts in the roof tiles of the building. In court on Thursday all of the schoolboys confirmed they understood the charges and a police officer gave evidence that she believed she could connect each of the defendants to their respective offences. A prosecuting lawyer told the judge a full file was due to be received by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) next month so asked for the case to be put back until a date after that. Defence lawyers for the four schoolboys did not raise any objections to this. Granting bail to all four of the accused, district judge Peter King adjourned the case until August. ""Its probably going to be Halloween time before theres substantial movement given how serious the allegations are, the judge said. Four schoolboys have appeared in court charged in relation to a fire at a derelict former nightclub building in Limavady, County Londonderry. More than 50 firefighters tackled the blaze at the former Sweet nightclub on Catherine Street on 30 May. The three 12-year-olds and one 14-year-old, who cannot be named due to their age, appeared separately at Coleraine Youth Court on Thursday. Crews from Coleraine, Limavady, Londonderry, Dungiven, Strabane, Magherafelt, Maghera and Castlederg all attended the fire. All four defendants are charged with burglary of the property and intent to cause unlawful damage in relation to the blaze.

Free-range egg farm proposal rejected,"Concerns were raised about the potential impact of odour and noise on the nearby Winston Bridge holiday park, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. One objector worried the River Tees could be polluted by waste, impacting fish stocks, other wildlife and people who use the river for leisure. David Lobley added: ""I have no wish to see it become a river where the water doesnt flow and it boils with every poison you can think of. Despite concerns over the scale of the proposed farm, the applicant Zoe Huxtable said the average size of free egg units in the UK is 32,000 birds. But the council's refusal notice claimed the land which would be lost ""positively contributes to the character of the local area and wider landscape"". It continued: The development has not provided evidence that its impacts could be adequately mitigated in respect of Nutrient Neutrality and therefore, adverse impacts on the Teesmouth and Cleveland Coast Special Protection Area cannot be ruled out in regard to nitrate. The applicant has been contacted for comment.

From politics to picking peonies for veteran MP,"Philip Dunne won his first parliamentary election in 2005 with a majority of 2,027 votes. His vote share increased during all four subsequent elections, winning 64% of the vote in 2019. Dunne had two ministerial roles in government, serving as the minister for defence procurement from 2012 to 2016 and a minister of state for health for 18 months from 2016. For the past six years he has been the chairman of the Environmental Audit Committee. All MPs stopped representing their constituencies on Thursday, when Parliament was dissolved, officially kicking off the general election period. ""In one sense there is a degree of liberation, knowing I'm not going into an election campaign,"" he told BBC Radio Shropshire. ""But on the other hand there's now a void in my life, because I haven't worked out what I'm going to do next. ""It was certainly very emotional leaving the House of Commons ... there was a frog in my throat when I shook hands with the deputy speaker. ""I felt pretty nostalgic, pretty emotional and pretty sad, because it has been the honour of my life to represent my home area.""

Fugitive prisoner arrested after month on the run,"Merseyside Police released images of Gee smiling and wearing a blue vest taken after his arrest. At the time of his disappearance, the Ministry of Justice confirmed Gee had gone missing from a Category D prison and said it was a ""rare scenario"". CCTV images were later circulated of him appearing to board a train from Darlington to Liverpool Lime Street with a woman. Gee was serving an imprisonment for public protection (IPP) sentence, a jail term introduced in 2005 for serious crimes and persistent criminals but abolished in 2012. Under an IPP, sentences are indeterminate rather than fixed-term, with a minimum period served in custody before the prisoner is considered for release. But in some cases prisoners have remained behind bars for many years after their minimum terms have expired. Gee had been found guilty of two counts of threats to kill and another two of blackmail at a trial in Liverpool in 2009. He had already admitted conspiracy to possess firearms and ammunition. The court heard he had previously been the subject of months of police surveillance that recorded him making threats and trying to obtain firearms. The jury heard he had been shot in the stomach outside a pub in the Anfield area on New Year's Day in 2008. He went on to make threatening phone calls to the family of the man jailed for shooting him.

Fujitsu engineer told to tone down evidence,"On Wednesday, the inquiry was shown drafts of witness statements by Mr Jenkins, drawn up as Post Office prosecutors prepared their case against Mr Thomas. In his first draft, Mr Jenkins said system failure could be one of the reasons behind the problems at Mr Thomass branch, adding that such failures are normal occurrences. The inquiry was shown how this line had been deleted, in edits to the document made by Post Office investigator Graham Ward. Mr Ward added in tracked changes to the document: This is a really poor choice of words which seems to accept that failures in the system are normal and therefore may well support the postmasters' claim that the system is to blame for losses !!!! In a separate email to Mr Jenkins, Mr Ward told him his statement needed work, saying it was potentially very damaging and that the Post Office needed to ensure it was not embarrassed in court. At the inquiry Mr Jenkins was asked if he agreed that Mr Ward was trying to influence a witness statement to be used in criminal proceedings before the Crown Court. I think it could be interpreted in that way,"" he replied. Mr Jenkins said it was clear Mr Ward wanted to use less emotive language, but that he was happy with the wording he had ended up with. Mr Jenkins' statement was not ultimately heard in court, as Mr Thomas pleaded guilty. Lead counsel Jason Beer also asked Mr Jenkins a series of questions about how much he knew about Fujitsu's ability to remotely access sub-postmasters' computers. In its prosecutions, the Post Office had argued that Horizon could not be accessed remotely by any other party. The Post Office said that therefore the accused sub-postmasters must have been responsible for the shortfalls in their accounts. But this turned out to be untrue, depriving those accused of an important line of defence. Remote access was not only possible by Fujitsu's engineers, it could be done without leaving any trace, in a way that was indistinguishable from changes made by sub-postmasters. Mr Jenkins told Mr Beer he had only found this out in 2018. However, an earlier key witness at the inquiry, Second Sight forensic investigator Ian Henderson, suggested that Mr Jenkins was aware that remote access was possible much earlier. Mr Henderson alleged that Mr Jenkins had told him in 2012 that Fujitsu ""routinely used remote access to branch terminals"" without sub-postmasters' knowledge or consent. This included making ""keystrokes that were indistinguishable from a sub-postmaster accessing the terminal directly"". When challenged over Mr Henderson's testimony, Mr Jenkins said he did not think he would have said that, but added that the general details of remote access were accurate. He said it was correct ""that there was remote access, yes, but not in terms of the gory details"" given by Mr Henderson. Mr Jenkins is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of perjury. A former Fujitsu software engineer who appeared as an expert witness in court has admitted the Post Office asked him to alter his draft witness statement to make it less emotive. The public inquiry into the Horizon scandal heard that evidence that Gareth Jenkins was preparing for the case against sub-postmaster Noel Thomas was changed to save the Post Office embarrassment. Mr Thomas was sentenced to nine months for false accounting in 2006 and spent his 60th birthday in prison. He was one of more than 700 sub-postmasters who were prosecuted for fraud and theft by the Post Office, based on faulty data from Fujitsu's Horizon accounting system. Mr Jenkins, who helped to develop the system, was being questioned for a second day at the public inquiry into the scandal. On Tuesday, he apologised for his role in the wrongful conviction of sub-postmistress Seema Misra, who was jailed for theft when she was eight weeks pregnant. However, Ms Misra told the BBC that the statement from Mr Jenkins was ""too little, too late"". On Wednesday, the inquiry was shown drafts of witness statements by Mr Jenkins, drawn up as Post Office prosecutors prepared their case against Mr Thomas.

Fujitsu expert: I didn't think Horizon was a monster,"Between 1999 and 2015, the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters on the strength of faulty Horizon data, with 700 convicted of offences such as theft and false accounting. Horizon falsely flagged discrepancies in accounts, with many sub-postmasters using their own savings to make good the imaginary shortfalls. The wrongful prosecutions, which have been called one of the biggest British miscarriages of justice, had a devastating effect on the lives of the sub-postmasters affected. They faced financial ruin and the loss of standing in their communities. Some sub-postmasters ended up taking their own lives after being pursued by the Post Office for supposed losses, including Martin Griffiths, whose widow was later paid in instalments by the Post Office for her silence, the inquiry heard in April. Giving his fourth day of evidence at the inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was questioned by Ms Page, a barrister who represented Horizon victims including Seema Misra. Ms Misra was pregnant with her second child when she was convicted of theft and sent to jail in 2010. She later told the BBC she would have killed herself had she not been pregnant at the time. In a charged atmosphere at the hearing, with Ms Misra sitting next to her, Ms Page accused Mr Jenkins of being a ""Fujitsu man"". She said Mr Jenkins ""knew the Misra trial was a test case for Horizon"". Ms Page alleged his role was to make sure Horizon had a ""clean bill of health"" and that he had ""tailored"" his evidence accordingly. ""My role was to tell the truth,"" Mr Jenkins said. ""I attempted to answer as best I could the questions I was asked"". Ms Page responded: ""Never mind whether a by-product of protecting the monster was that a woman was sent to jail"". Mr Jenkins said he was ""sorry for had happened to Mrs Misra"" but he felt that was down the to way that the Post Office had behaved and wasn't ""purely down to me"". ""I clearly got trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done, but that was not intentional on my behalf,"" he said. Mr Jenkins was part of the Fujitsu team that developed the Horizon software, and part of his role was dealing with bugs in the system. Mr Jenkins has maintained throughout his evidence that he didn't understand his previous duties as an expert witness to tell the court about problems with Horizon, and that he didn't know that he shouldn't just narrowly answer questions about the technology. Under questioning at the inquiry on Friday, Mr Jenkins said: ""I appreciate that I got things very wrong, but it was done through ignorance rather than maliciousness"". He added that the Horizon system ""as a whole was working well"". Mr Jenkins is currently being investigated by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of perjury - lying to a court, and perverting the course of justice. No criminal charges have been brought. Responding to Mr Jenkins' questioning, Ms Misra told the BBC that Horizon is a ""monster who killed people"". She said she didn't believe Mr Jenkins' testimony, and that he is ""just trying to cover his own back"". Ms Misra added that on a personal level, hearing Mr Jenkins' testimony over the past days had been ""really bad"". ""I had to go into the loo to cry and scream,"" she said. ""I didn't want to show my tears to him"". However, getting the testimony out in the open had been ""good"", she added. ""That gives me the power to keep on fighting,"" she said, and that she felt she has the UK ""nation behind me"". Former Fujitsu engineer and Horizon expert Gareth Jenkins has said he didn't think the software was ""a monster"" and that he was ""trapped into doing things I shouldn't have done"". Speaking at an inquiry into the Horizon scandal, Mr Jenkins was accused by lawyer Flora Page of ""protecting"" it when he gave evidence as an expert witness between 2010 and 2013. Ms Page represents Horizon victims including former sub-postmaster Seema Misra, who Mr Jenkins gave evidence against in 2010.

Funeral director releases children's book on grief,"Mr Adams, who helps run his family's funeral directors, said it was important to have conversations about death with young people when arranging and conducting funerals. ""These things that we do now can have a profound impact on our future selves,"" he told BBC Radio Shropshire. ""I hope that [the book] will show people there's another way we can grieve and go through bereavement."" Don't Tell The Children also discusses small acts that can help young people with the grieving process, like offering the opportunity for them to see a coffin. ""It's not saying every young person should be involved,"" he said. ""It's just saying that we need to have conversations. Some young people don't want to be involved. ""We need to listen and show everybody that their voices matter."" The book ties in to Mr Adams' campaign to introduce bereavement lessons in schools. In 2023, he launched a petition which reached more than 10,000 signatures. It was due to be debated in Parliament on Monday but was postponed due to the general election. ""We're living in a more clinical society now, even accepting death is a very difficult thing for us all,"" Mr Adams said. ""I really believe there's a societal, cultural shift on the horizon, and actually the impact of that isn't scary and doom and gloom. ""It's a more compassionate kind of society for us to live in.""

"Funfair injuries not life-threatening, say police","A man and woman who were taken to hospital after a funfair ride malfunctioned at a country show in south London are no longer believed to be in a life-threatening condition, the Metropolitan Police has said. Officers and the Health and Safety Executive continue to investigate the incident on Saturday evening at Lambeth Country Show in Brockwell Park. Police had previously said the pair, both in their 40s, had ""life-threatening injuries"". Two other people, a man in his 50s and an 11-year-old girl who were injured in the incident, have since been discharged from hospital. nan The problem occurred during the first day of the free event and funfair rides were closed on Sunday. One of the fairground rides was seen covered in tarpaulin, although it was not clear which ride had malfunctioned. The council said emergency services had arrived at the scene shortly after the incident at 18:20 BST and the funfair had been closed. Additional safety checks were being carried out on all rides and attractions at the show, Lambeth Council said.

GCSE results day 2024: When do results come out?,"GCSE results will come out from 08:00 onwards on Thursday, 22 August. If you are collecting them in person, check with your school for an exact time. In England, GCSEs are now graded using a numerical system from 9-1, rather than A-E, as was previously the case. Students need a 4 for a ""standard pass"" and 5 for a ""strong pass"". In Wales and Northern Ireland, GCSEs are graded using letters, unless an exam taken in those nations comes under an English exam board. Grade boundaries show the minimum number of marks you need for each grade. They are decided by examiners and published on results day. Qualification Wales, which oversees Welsh exams, has said there is still a risk that performance in some subjects has not fully recovered since the pandemic. So, it will use statistics to help set the grade boundaries, to prevent marks dropping below 2019 levels. In England and Northern Ireland, the way boundaries are decided has returned to normal. Only one change remained in place this year. Ofqual, England's exam regulator, said students in maths, physics, and combined-science exams were allowed to use formulae and equation sheets for the final time. This will not be allowed in 2025. If you don't think your grade is right, you should first talk to your school or college. It will contact the exam board on your behalf and ask for your marks to be reviewed. If you still think you have been unfairly graded after a review, you can ask your school or college to appeal. If you are still not satisfied, you can request a review from Ofqual. The charity YoungMinds says results are not the only measure of success - and if things do not turn out as you had hoped, there are lots of other ways to help you achieve your goals. What if I fail a GCSE exam? You can resit any GCSE exam the following academic year. The resits for GCSE maths and English, which are both mandatory subjects, take place from 5 November. If you want to explore this option, you should speak to your school about the best course of action. Under-18s must remain in official education or training. You may choose to stay in full-time education, start an apprenticeship or work while studying part-time. Many pupils go on to study A-levels. International Baccalaureate (IB) is also an option. There are also a range of vocational courses you could take, such as National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs), BTec Level 3s, TechBacs, Cambridge Technicals and (in England only) T-levels. You could also consider an apprenticeship. Apprentices get paid a salary, as they spend 80% of their time in the workplace while being trained. The National Careers Service has more information about your options. Scotland has a different qualification system, with Nationals, instead of GCSEs, and Highers, which are similar to A-levels. Results day in Scotland is Tuesday 6 August."
GP practice criticised over medicine monitoring,"The CQC carried out a planned inspection of the practice in December, with its assessment updated in April. ""We found that patients who were prescribed high-risk medicines were not always monitored appropriately to ensure safe care and treatment was provided,"" it said.

A Care Quality Commission (CQC) assessment rated the Friarsgate Practice in Winchester as Requires Improvement. It found breaches of health regulations and concluded there was a ""lack of effective governance systems"" within the practice. The Friarsgate Practice said its systems had already been ""reviewed and where necessary rectified"". The CQC carried out a planned inspection of the practice in December, with its assessment updated in April. ""We found that patients who were prescribed high-risk medicines were not always monitored appropriately to ensure safe care and treatment was provided,"" it said.

Garden designer wins 'Best Show Garden' at Chelsea Flower Show,"The design of the garden is inspired by the ancient Japanese practice of forest bathing, or Shinrin-yoku, which means relaxing and reconnecting with nature through our senses. A large knapped flint wall was chosen by the designer for its texture and form which is similar to muscle cells and serves as a tool for explaining what muscular dystrophy is and the devastating effect it can have on muscles. The garden of more than 60 trees and plants includes a hub at its centre, which provides a sheltered space for people to meet and share their experiences outside the clinical environment. The garden and landscape designer was previously awarded RHS Young Designer of the Year at the RHS Flower Show Tatton Park 2017 which helped launch her career. Ms Maria said on receiving the award Its incredible, I cant believe it, its amazing. She said: The reason for designing a garden this year is very different and special. I was approached by the wonderful people at Muscular Dystrophy UK (MDUK) to see how we could shine a light on their incredible work and community. I am so excited to be working with MDUK as I know how positive and meaningful exhibiting at the show this year will be, she added. RHS Chair of Show Garden Judges Liz Nicholson said this year was ""one of the toughest years to judge"" with some ""fantastic narratives and storytelling"" amongst the gardens. She said: ""Ulas design is a wonderful slice of forest edge brought to the heart of the RHS Chelsea showground. It is immersive, relaxing and calming...it is a clear winner. Silver medal winner for 'Best Show Garden' was The Flood Resilient Garden, designed by Naomi Slade & Dr Ed Barsley. The garden was designed to be a relatable, enjoyable and beautiful space to help reduce flood risk and to recover quickly after periods of heavy rainfall. After the show, the garden will be permanently rehomed to Howbery Business Park in Oxfordshire, which is owned by HR Wallingford, an organisation that researches and develops resilient approaches to flooding.

A garden designer said she is so proud after her work was named 'Best Show Garden' at the Chelsea Flower Show. London designer Ula Maria was awarded a gold medal for her Muscular Dystrophy UK - Forest Bathing Garden. The garden showcases how an immersive, yet accessible, garden can offer a place of refuge to those affected by the muscle wasting condition. After the show the garden was going to the Institute of Developmental and Regenerative Medicine in Oxford where groundbreaking research takes place but is now going to a Hospice in Glasgow.

Gardeners' plea over leak at 'parched' allotments,"Mr Forbes said the leak had been reported in February after a plot flooded. ""We haven't had any water for months,"" he added. According to the council's website, water is metered for allotment sites and the charge distributed between all tenanted plots. The annual cost for a plot at Carr Lane, inclusive of water and rent, is £112.38. A spokesperson for the council said a water feed had been turned off on 7 June, due to a leak from underground pipes. Anglian Water visited the site on Tuesday and started excavation work ""to resolve"" the issue, the spokesperson added. Last Friday, the water was turned on for four hours to allow plot-holders to fill water butts. ""Water has been available on the allotment throughout, via other working standpipes,"" the spokesperson said. ""We are working hard to have the water leak repaired as quickly as possible, and we thank all of the allotment plot holders for their continued cooperation.""

Gareth Jenkins: An 'unreliable god' at the heart of the Post Office scandal,"His appearance is keenly anticipated, having been postponed twice. A top lawyer working for the Post Office once described Gareth Jenkins as an unreliable god"", the inquiry heard. For sub-postmasters, this so-called architect of Horizon has become as well-known as former Post Office CEO Paula Vennells. His name has featured repeatedly, often many times a day throughout these hearings, says David Enright, solicitor with Howe & Co, which represents many of the victims. He believes Mr Jenkins will be subjected to the most robust questioning at the inquiry. From 2005, Mr Jenkins was pivotal in helping the Post Office defend its faulty computer software system in criminal and civil cases. He was the go to Fujitsu expert on any question of its reliability, says David Enright. In 2010, Mr Jenkins gave evidence in the trial of Seema Misra at Guildford Crown Court. She told the BBC: I was naïve at that time. I thought it was a good thing that he was working for Fujitsu because he would know the system inside out. If anything was going wrong in Horizon, he would have seen it. What Mrs Misra did not know was that shortly before the trial, Mr Jenkins had flagged a bug that affected dozens of branch accounts, and that he had suggested remotely accessing their computer terminals as one way of fixing the problem. Mr Jenkins did not disclose this in court. Mrs Misra was found guilty of theft and false accounting and was sent to prison whilst pregnant. If the problems had been revealed at the time, it could have stopped all the prosecutions in their tracks. Two years later, solicitors acting for sub-postmaster Kim Wylie asked about remote access. Mr Jenkins sought guidance on what to say, warning a Post Office lawyer that including this possibility could lead to more scrutiny of the organisation. His final witness statement confirmed that this could happen, and he went on to say in his final version that altering branch accounts in this way was rare and needed to be authorised by the Post Office. Mr Jenkins appeared as an expert witness in a number of Post Office prosecutions of sub-postmasters. The law states that expert witnesses must be independent and unbiased. But the inquiry has heard evidence that lawyers never properly instructed Mr Jenkins about his duties. Documents obtained by the BBC earlier this year showed that a Post Office prosecutor suggested Mr Jenkins should rephrase some of his court testimony used against Seema Misra, which strengthened his assertions over the robustness of Horizon. IT expert Jason Coyne, who was once used as an expert witness in a Post Office case, believes Mr Jenkins was someone the Post Office could manage. We sometimes call people the hired guns. Theres a risk thats what the Post Office was trying to do with him, says Mr Coyne. The BBC understands Mr Jenkins was involved in at least 15 Post Office investigations. By 2012, independent forensic investigators Second Sight were brought in to examine the Horizon system. At the time they praised Mr Jenkins ""superb"" expertise - not knowing that his evidence was being used in the courts. However, soon after their interim report, revealing several bugs, the Post Office received legal advice warning that Mr Jenkins' previous omissions had fatally undermined his credibility as an expert witness, and they should stop using him. But Mr Jenkins remained a key figure behind the scenes. He provided technical support and information to witnesses who testified at the 2019 Bates v Post Office trial, despite not being called to give evidence. During the trial, lawyers representing sub-postmasters labelled him a ""shadow expert"" - someone who advises but does not testify in court. The Post Office was criticised for not acknowledging that his absence might have related to its concerns over his evidence in the past criminal prosecutions. The judge, Mr Justice Fraser, recommended that the head of the Crown Prosecution Service start an investigation into perjury against Mr Jenkins. As part of its contract with the Post Office, Fujitsu provided support for legal cases involving the Horizon system. But that didnt always cover Mr Jenkins work, so the Post Office had to pay extra. The inquiry heard sometimes costs were a factor in whether the Post Office adequately investigated concerns over shortfalls in sub-postmasters branches. When sub-postmaster Grant Allen experienced a shortfall of £3,000 at his branch in Cheshire, a lawyer working for the Post Office asked Mr Jenkins for an estimate for two days of data analysis. Emails from December 2012 released by the inquiry show Mr Jenkins replied, saying data up to 7 years is freely available. Two days of my time costs around £2k-£2.5k."" The decision to do the data analysis was ultimately rejected. The BBC put the contents of this story to Mr Jenkins. A lawyer representing him said it would be ""inappropriate"" for him to comment ahead of him giving evidence at the inquiry. The Post Office said it gave a heartfelt apology to victims and ""remained focused"" on supporting the ongoing inquiry. Fujitsu declined to answer the BBC's specific questions but said it regards ""this matter with the utmost seriousness. The former Fujitsu engineer who helped design the faulty Horizon software at the centre of the Post Office scandal is under the spotlight this week. You might not have heard of Gareth Jenkins until now but he has become a key figure during the long-running Post Office Inquiry. He will be questioned at the inquiry over his involvement in the scandal, which saw more than 900 sub-postmasters wrongly prosecuted between 1999 and 2015 after Horizon made it look like money was missing from branch accounts. On Tuesday Mr Jenkins will begin giving evidence over four days  the longest run of questions any witness has faced. Heres why what he's got to say is so important. His appearance is keenly anticipated, having been postponed twice. A top lawyer working for the Post Office once described Gareth Jenkins as an unreliable god"", the inquiry heard.

Gaza protest campsite at university dismantled,"One  protester told the BBC they had no choice but to leave after having been ""trapped"" for 48 hours. They also claimed they no longer had access to bathrooms and toilets. Tractors, vehicles, and workers have since been seen dismantling the camp. The BBC has approached the university for comment on these measures. Israel launched a military campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to the group's cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 252 others were taken hostage. More than 37,590 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Protesters said Oxford University ""capitalised"" on a ""moment of transition"" on Sunday while they were off-site preparing to turn part of the camp outside the museum into a community garden. One accused the university of ""spending more time talking about the health of grass and of the lawn than of 40,000 dead Palestinians"". A university statement said the lawn was an ""important space"" for ""visitors to enjoy and relax in"", and it wanted to ""remove any hazards"". It was also aiming to prevent damage to its irrigation system, its ""protective membrane"", and the museum collections beneath, it claimed. It said before the planned gardening event campaigners were ""informed on several occasions"" that it could not go ahead, and so ""urgent action"" was required. But OA4P insisted the fences went up ""with no prior communication"". Campaigners, who worked on the community garden on Monday night, said the results were ""beautiful"". They left the site shortly after, and footage has been posted on social media of the garden being demolished by a loader tractor. Protesters had called for the university to disclose all finances and overhaul university investment policy. The institution said it respected their ""right to freedom of expression in the form of peaceful protests"" and expressed ""profound sympathy for those suffering in Gaza, Israel, and the West Bank"". OA4P also started a sit-in at university offices in Wellington Square on 23 May, leading to several arrests. Other pro-Palestine demonstrators forced the university to cancel some of its students' end of year exams after buildings were occupied. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Gaza: Long campaign by Israel may follow war,"The reference to all fronts is very much focused on the situation on Israel's northern border, where there's been a recent upsurge both in fighting and rhetoric in Israel's confrontation with the Lebanese armed movement Hezbollah.  It's led to speculation that a new, all out war could be looming between Israel and another of its long-term antagonists in the region. Mr Netanyahu has said that further scaling down the fighting in Gaza would free up troops to redeploy to the border with Lebanon.  To underline the priority this front is increasingly assuming for Israel, Mr Netanyahu has been up near the border, observing a drill by troops. The Israeli President Isaac Herzog has also just spent two days in the region, not just visiting the military but also several of the communities that have been affected by Hezbollah's near-daily attacks since 8 October. Lebanese communities have also suffered as Israel has struck back. Whatever happens on Israel's northern border, the conflict in Gaza, even if at a far lower level of intensity, shows no sign of coming to an end. Moves towards a ceasefire have lost momentum again, with neither Israel nor Hamas appearing ready to fully embrace all elements of the proposal laid out by President Biden. There's been much talk of what happens on the Day After.  The Israeli war cabinet was dissolved by Mr Netanyahu after one of its members, Benny Gantz, left it, citing the prime minister's failure to lay out a post-war plan as the main reason for his resignation. It's still unclear if there is such a plan. In a recent interview with a friendly Israeli media outlet, Mr Netanyahu said that it was clear that ""military control in the foreseeable future will be ours"". He went on to give what were perhaps his most detailed comments so far on how he envisions the post-war situation in Gaza: ""We also want to create a civilian administration, if possible with local Palestinians, and maybe with external backing from countries in the region, to manage humanitarian supply and later on civilian affairs in the [Gaza] Strip."" This chimes with what the Biden administration is hoping to achieve. Latest reports suggest that Egypt and the UAE are prepared to take part in a security force that might operate in Gaza after the war. But the very concept of a Day After in Gaza may itself be somewhat optimistic.  Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters continue to be able to reappear in areas from  where they were driven out earlier in Israel's campaign, in what has essentially become a form of guerrilla warfare. The Israeli military's chief spokesperson, Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari has recently described the aim of destroying Hamas - making it disappear - as ""simply throwing sand in the eyes of the public"". He said that Hamas was an idea rooted in the hearts of the people and that ""anyone who thinks we can eliminate Hamas is wrong"". This is a message that does not appear to have got through to Mr Netanyahu. He has held hard to his maximalist goal of a total defeat of Hamas, militarily and politically - although that may undergo some element of reformulation in the coming weeks and months.  That is why he has continued to insist on Israel having the freedom to continue military operations when necessary, even if a ceasefire is agreed. When he reiterated that in his interview with Channel 14, there were reports of disappointment among US officials that he was essentially negating the cornerstone of the ceasefire plan that President Biden not only announced but described as Israel's own proposal. Hamas seized the opportunity to accuse Mr Netanyahu of preventing a ceasefire agreement - although officially the White House has put the onus on Hamas. In Israel, the families of the hostages still held in Gaza - alive or dead - have also increasingly denounced Mr Netanyahu as being the main obstacle in the way of securing the release of their relatives. In their latest demonstration, hostages' families again blocked roads across Israel.  On one highway, they set a metal cage on fire, with the word Help emblazoned on it. In a statement, they said: ""Netanyahu has given up on the hostages. They can be buried in Gaza so long as he keeps his seat."" This third phase of Israel's war in Gaza may be at a lower intensity. But with no sign that it will end any time soon, the prospects of a ceasefire, the release of hostages and the beginning of a process in which Palestinians can rebuild their lives remain on hold. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's recent comments that the intense phase of fighting in Gaza was about to end essentially confirmed what has become increasingly clear in the past few months. The Israeli army has portrayed its current operation in the southern city of Rafah as its last major ground offensive  in Gaza. It went ahead, despite concerted international opposition.  It has involved Israeli strikes that have killed large numbers of Palestinian civilians.  But it has not seen the remorseless level of bombardment that characterised earlier assaults on Gaza City and Khan Younis. Israeli forces backed by tanks are still battling with Palestinian fighters in the west of Rafah, while the army continues to demolish swathes of buildings in the city. The IDF has said that it has severely degraded three of the four Hamas battalions that it has said remain in Rafah, which was Israel's main aim.  That holds out the possibility that the army may soon declare that the operation has been completed. None of this has been any solace to the people of Gaza.  There's been little or no respite for them.  Casualty figures from the health ministry in Gaza - run by Hamas - are still recording around 40 to 60 deaths a day. Israel is carrying out strikes every day elsewhere in Gaza - both in the north and in the centre.  There is no current prospect of an end to this.  Key to Mr Netanyahu's strategy in Gaza is the freedom for Israel to mount attacks when and where it considers necessary, even if at some point all its troops have been withdrawn from the enclave. In Washington, the Israeli defence minister Yoav Gallant has been discussing with top US officials what he himself called Phase C - the third, less intensive stage - of Israel's campaign from relatively early on in the conflict. He told the US special envoy Amos Hochstein in one of his first meetings during his four day visit that the transition to Phase C  would ""impact developments on all fronts, and that Israel was preparing for every scenario both militarily and diplomatically"". That message is one he will have continued to drive home in subsequent discussions with the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin. The reference to all fronts is very much focused on the situation on Israel's northern border, where there's been a recent upsurge both in fighting and rhetoric in Israel's confrontation with the Lebanese armed movement Hezbollah.  It's led to speculation that a new, all out war could be looming between Israel and another of its long-term antagonists in the region.

General election 2024 poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,"If the chart above hasn't loaded, please click here Get the individual poll data Latest update: 29 June 2024 There's quite a lot of variation between the polls but they all agree that Labour has a big lead over the Conservatives, writes senior political analyst Peter Barnes. The polls have had quite a broad range of figures over the last few days, particularly for the Conservatives and Reform UK. This is partly explained by how different polling companies deal with people who say they're undecided about how to vote - but there's certainly more variation than at the same stage of the last election campaign in 2019. However, if you look at the poll averages, there's been very little change for any of the parties over the last ten days or so. Labour still has a lead of around 20 points over the Conservatives with Reform UK in third and the Liberal Democrats in fourth. All polls are based on a sample of people interviewed, typically more than 1,000, which is then weighted to be representative of the country. There is always a margin of error, meaning the real percentage could be higher or lower than any one poll suggests. We estimate that the true support for each party lies within the ranges shown here. Each dot in the chart shows one poll result for a party. We summarise all that information with an average line that makes it easier to understand the trend.

We only include the headline percentages on voting intention, which pollsters calculate by excluding or otherwise adjusting for those people who answered ""don't know"" or ""won't vote"". Most of the polls included cover Great Britain, although some do poll the whole of the UK. People surveyed do not get the option to choose parties which only stand in Northern Ireland. We include data that is in the public domain. Some polling companies will not publish all data for all parties at the same time. Where polling companies have stated in their data tables who their client is, we have included this in our table. It is common for polling companies to do their work for news organisations, television programmes and campaign groups. The true position for the Conservatives and Labour might be within five percentage points of our average. Nine out of 10 polls just before election day have been within that range of the eventual national vote shares in the 2010 to 2019 general elections. The gap has been smaller for other parties which campaign throughout Great Britain, such as the Liberal Democrats, Green party and Reform UK (formerly the Brexit Party) and smaller still for the SNP and Plaid Cymru. Our estimate of a party's support is a rolling average of polls. A party's share on any given day is the average of their results from polls taken over the previous fortnight. We only take the most recent poll from each company for that day's averages. All opinion polls will differ a bit because they are interviewing different people. There are also other things that can lead to differences between polling companies. For example: For voting intention, polling companies typically ask interviewees a question along the lines of: ""If a general election were held tomorrow, which party would you vote for?"" Some polling companies have not given their interviewees the choice of some parties, including them within the ""other"" category. For example, Reform UK, formerly the Brexit Party until 2021, has only been included as an option in every poll featured in our tracker since autumn 2022, while support for Plaid Cymru is included among ""other"" parties in polls released by Techne.

Ghost-hunting in a 'haunted' Highland theatre,"The venue is a mix of old and new - with cinemas, bars and one of Scotland's largest auditoriums. The oldest part - the Bishop's Palace - is reputed to be haunted by a ghost dubbed the green lady because of her colour. Deputy stage manager Paul Findlay has been involved with Eden Court for 27 years, and is interested in the supernatural. ""I grew up in Orkney in an old farmhouse that was said to be haunted,"" he says. ""A couple of times I have come through the Bishop's Palace when the lights are off. ""I have come to the bottom of the stairs and thought to myself 'I don't want to go any further'. ""It feels like I am going to see something I don't want to see."" One of the ""most haunted"" sites is said to be a room of the sub stage, an area underneath the main theatre's stage. Paul says: ""Whenever I come out of the room I always feel like I am being followed."" BBC Scotland digital platform The Social visited Eden Court in search of answers. Holly, a member of staff, told The Social: ""We have had quite a few instances of staff seeing the green lady at the top of the Bishop's Palace stairway. ""If you are coming into the Bishop's Palace and look into a mirror there you will see her standing at the top of the stairs or walking up them. ""I haven't seen her, but there have been quite a few accounts of that."" Holly says other reported experiences around Eden Court include whispered conversations and a haunting laugh. Eerie sights and sounds have been reported across the riverside complex. A bar manager said he heard footsteps as he locked up late at night. He told the person to ""hurry up"" but, when he turned to look, no-one was there. He was so spooked that for about a week after he made sure he had someone else with him at closing time. A duty manager reported hearing a woman crying as she was locking up in the front foyer next to the box office. She checked the whole place again, but found no-one. Male ghosts are said to haunt the bars, and there have been reports of a phantom child and a couple that vanish into thin air. Marketing manager Neil Hepburn said there were generations of ghost stories. He says: ""If a building can create such enduring stories amongst its residents, then the question of a rational explanation for all the sightings feels irrelevant.

He says there are explanations for the spooky experiences. ""Quite a few coincide with late-night activity - cleaning up, responsibilities for front of house or the bar,"" he says. ""Any environment that has been busy and then becomes suddenly quiet is going to be naturally spooky."" He says people might be seeing and hearing things while in a hypnagogic state. It is usually associated with the stage between wakefulness and sleep, but can sometimes be experienced by a person as they carry out a routine task.

Glastonbury wings sculpture inspired by mental health,"If you've been to Glastonbury Festival, you have probably come across a set of magnificent colourful wings, or even had your picture taken in front them. They first appeared in 2017, after Mr Phillips was scouted by co-organiser of the festival, Emily Eavis. Mr Phillips says since then, they have become ""one of the most sought after pictures opportunities"" at the festival, with crowds queueing up to capture his work. ""This year, they've asked me to put one by the stone circle, which is massive in terms of the spiritual heart of Glastonbury,"" he said. ""To be asked to put one there is really touching."" The stone circle at Glastonbury is a megalithic monument located at Worthy Farm. They are viewed culturally as gateways between two realms, where one could cross over into a world of beauty and abundance, gaining wisdom, healing, or inspiration. Mr Phillips said his vision for the wings was borne from a ""difficult period"" of mental health issues, and now symbolises strength, beauty and resilience. ""I like making windows with a bit of contemporary difference,"" Mr Phillips said. ""I went through quite a low patch in my life, and one of the inspirations that came from that was this vision of these soaring wings. ""It was like a piece of a stained glass window brought down to earth."" Measuring 5m (16.4ft) by 2.5m (8.23ft), Mr Phillips said: ""They're huge, I always wanted it to look like you could actually fly in them."" After struggling with his own mental health, Mr Phillips said he wants his art to become an outlet for others. ""I'm all about free access to art,"" he said. ""So after the festivals I install them at Wells Cathedral and the Bishop's Palace, in places where people who wouldn't necessarily get to see them, can still interact with them. ""I've gone from 'I've got to get my art out there', to 'now it's my time to give back to the community which looked after me'."" Follow BBC Somerset on Facebook and X.

Godmother's fight to get 10-year-old girl buried,"Shay and her mother lived with Ms Coclough for the first five to six years of Shay's life, when Ms Coclough took Ms Kaur into her home after she had to leave shared accommodation during her pregnancy. Neither of them had partners so they shared the role of parenting. ""My sisters have got children but I don't, all my love I put into Shay,"" Ms Coclough said. ""Me and my mom were at the birth. I was the one that cut her cord. ""She was just such a lovely child - so happy and bubbly. She was perfect. ""She was my whole world. She still is."" Ms Coclough said she had tried to arrange a funeral for her goddaughter but the coroners refused to release the 10-year-old's body without parental consent. ""We're left in the dark because we're not next of kin,"" she said. ""She's never going to grow up and get married and have her own children. ""I just don't want her to get a pauper's grave. She needs to be buried."" The Black Country Coroners Service said it did not wish to make a comment when contacted by the BBC. Ms Coclough said she was struggling to sleep and had lost three stone (19kg) since Shay's death. She added: ""It's sickening. It just makes me feel ill. It's been weeks of torment. ""The law in that department, I think it's cruel."" She told the BBC she had contacted a solicitor but otherwise did not know what to do. While Shay's biological father had been tracked down, Ms Coclough said he wanted her to be responsible for the funeral. Rajnaara Chowdhury Akhtar, an associate professor at the University of Warwick who specialises in family and child law, told the BBC: ""Parents have a responsibility to bury their child. There is an obligation. Who can enforce that? Who is advocating for them?"" Dr Akhtar said there was a general common law position that bodies should be buried or cremated with proper ""respect"" and ""decency"" and ""without further delay"". She added that in a case in 2017, where the burial of a child's body was not arranged by either parent, the local authority got involved. The High Court has the power to order the release of a body by the coroner for burial, so the council applied to the court to release the child's body. ""In [this case] it was the local authority who applied - however I cannot see that this would be limited to the local authority,"" Dr Akhtar said. ""Family members should similarly be able to apply but resource limitations mean the local authority should probably take responsibility. ""Where the deceased child was already a 'looked after child or identified as in need, the local authority should be the ones taking these steps.""

Government needs 'commitment' to aerospace - expert,"nan He added: ""We know that to save the planet we need to be finding alternatives to the way we fly today and hydrogen is one of those alternatives, but it doesn't have a track record of being used in commercial aviation."" The Conservative government set a domestic aviation target of achieving net zero emissions by 2040 and the Cranfield Hydrogen Integration Incubator (CH2i), funded by the grant, aims to help achieve this. It will provide an environment to develop the production of technologies as well as storage tanks, aircraft designs and engines that are urgently required to accelerate the adoption of hydrogen in a net zero world. The project includes building new labs to create an on-site Hydrogen Integration Research Centre. Mr Westwood said the new government needed to provide ""commitment and stability"". ""That's what aerospace companies are looking for when they are making decisions about where they place their investment in research and development and it is a global competition,"" he said.

Government writes off £1.4bn of PPE from Covid deal,"Full Support Healthcare agreed a £1.78bn deal in April 2020 to deliver face masks, respirators, eye protection and aprons - the largest Covid PPE order from a single supplier, accounting for 13% of the governments total spend. Before the pandemic, the Northamptonshire-based company, which was already a specialist manufacturer of PPE, had 25 employees and annual profits of £800,000. Any profits since the contract was fulfilled are not known because in 2021 the co-directors, Sarah Stoute, 50, and her husband Richard, 53, based the business offshore in Jersey for privacy reasons. They and the company continue to pay all UK tax. Neither Full Support Healthcare nor the Stoutes have done anything improper. BBC Investigations made a series of requests over a six-month period under the Freedom of Information Act to NHS Supply Chain, which manages the delivery of healthcare products. The responses reveal that about £1.4bn worth of Full Support Healthcare's PPE will not be used. The figure includes some 749 million items that have already been burned or destroyed, including by energy from waste, and a further 825 million that are classified as excess stock where disposal and recycling are possible outcomes. Full Support provided 2.02 billion items of PPE, however, only 232 million items have been dispatched to the NHS or other care settings. The deal is almost certain to be the most wasteful of the Covid pandemic. Data compiled by data firm Tussell, shows only one contract was more costly and it was awarded to a range of suppliers providing mixed services. The government previously estimated that £85m worth of PPE secured under the contract would not be used, which is approximately 6% of the true total. We have asked the DHSC to explain this disparity and why so much of the PPE was never used. The BBC understands that at least £100m of public money has additionally been spent on storing and incinerating the excess stock since its purchase. Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said the money lost ""could have been used to pay the salaries of 37,000 nurses"". ""We all know that billions of pounds was wasted during the pandemic on corruption and incompetence, but what the BBC has uncovered is the worst example I have ever seen - £1.4bn on one contract, paying for PPE that was never used. ""It is staggering waste and I think we need a full and frank account as to how so much public money was thrown down the toilet,"" he said. The BBC contacted the DHSC and the Conservative Party several times with no reply to set out our findings and ask a number of questions. In an earlier statement the government said it had ""acted swiftly to procure PPE at the height of the pandemic, competing in an overheated global market where demand massively outstripped supply"". The Liberal Democrats said it would ""take steps to ensure such a colossal misuse of public funds never happened again"". According to Peter Smith, a former government procurement adviser and author,  the initial forecasts for how much PPE was going to be needed, ""were far higher than they should have been... with enormous targets of tens of billions of items"". ""I think the procurement people did what many of us would have done and slightly panicked to get the stuff in, or at least get the contracts in and hope the stuff arrived later - it was almost as though price didnt matter. ""It meant opportunists and middlemen in entirely unrelated industries could make extortionate margins by organising supply from China or wherever, sometimes literally doubling their purchase price,"" he said. Sarah Stoute, a former nurse, set up Full Support Healthcare in 2001 in Wellingborough and her husband became a director three years later. As experienced providers of PPE during previous pandemics, they moved quickly in late 2019 to boost supply as Coronavirus broke out. Under an existing arrangement with the NHS, their company won two DHSC purchase orders, including one for £1.78bn, for face masks and other items. Speaking at the time, Mrs Stoute said volumes of their product, shipped from China, increased from eight sea freight containers every month to 800. In a post on X, then known as Twitter, in October 2020 she wrote that her team of 25 people supplied one fifth of the PPE national stockpile. She added: Ive paid a few peoples mortgages off this last few weeks. Afterwards, Mrs Stoute and her husband bought a £30m seafront villa in Barbados; a yacht; a £6m house in the south of England and an international equestrian centre in Bedfordshire. Giving evidence to the Public Accounts Committee in 2021, she said they ""risked everything as a company and went into mass production with no security at all"". There is no suggestion the Stoutes or their company did anything wrong. Lawyers representing the Stoutes said: Full Support Healthcare stock arrived quickly by summer 2020, much earlier than most and in larger quantities. It had either a two- or three-year shelf life. This means the PPE products are more likely to have passed their use-by date. On the issue of the couple offshoring their business, their lawyers said: The choice to have the group company resident in Jersey was solely to maintain privacy for our clients and their family, especially given the repeated press intrusion. The couple and their company remain registered in the UK for tax. The Stoutes unsuccessfully brought legal action against News Group Newspapers in 2023 after the Sun on Sunday published images of them on a beach in Barbados. A judge ruled the couple, who were photographed after taking jet skis from their boat to a nearby restaurant, did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy. Last summer the Environment Agency took enforcement action to clear a stockpile of thousands of boxes of waste plastic medical aprons supplied by Full Support Healthcare. Documents obtained by the BBC in April show the dump on a farm near Calmore, Hampshire, ran to some 1,550 pallets and was considered to present a fire risk. The government had sold the pallets to a third-party private company while in the process of auctioning off excess PPE. Full Support was in no way responsible for the stockpile. The company's lawyers said the Stoutes were only made aware of the volume of unused stock when the BBC told them. They said it was a matter for the government who had not contacted them at any stage about it. Four years since the first national lockdown in England and Wales, the DHSC continues to store and dispose of billions of items of excess PPE at a cost of millions of pounds a week. At a press conference on Tuesday morning, the Health Secretary Victoria Atkins said the £1.4bn figure was ""not accepted"" but the DHSC has not specified a different one. Ms Atkins said on the wider point ""the whole country wanted us to get the PPE that our front-line staff needed both in healthcare and in social care, and we managed to procure billions of pieces of PPE equipment"". ""That was absolutely the right thing to do at the time,"" she added. A DHSC spokesperson said: We do not recognise the £1.4 billion quoted. Our position on PPE stock is set out in the departments annual accounts as audited by the National Audit Office. PPE was secured at the height of the pandemic, competing in an overheated global market where demand massively outstripped supply. Nearly half of all the remaining stock was sold, recycled, or donated by the department.

Before the pandemic, the Northamptonshire-based company, which was already a specialist manufacturer of PPE, had 25 employees and annual profits of £800,000. Any profits since the contract was fulfilled are not known because in 2021 the co-directors, Sarah Stoute, 50, and her husband Richard, 53, based the business offshore in Jersey for privacy reasons. They and the company continue to pay all UK tax. Neither Full Support Healthcare nor the Stoutes have done anything improper. BBC Investigations made a series of requests over a six-month period under the Freedom of Information Act to NHS Supply Chain, which manages the delivery of healthcare products. The responses reveal that about £1.4bn worth of Full Support Healthcare's PPE will not be used. The figure includes some 749 million items that have already been burned or destroyed, including by energy from waste, and a further 825 million that are classified as excess stock where disposal and recycling are possible outcomes. Full Support provided 2.02 billion items of PPE, however, only 232 million items have been dispatched to the NHS or other care settings. The deal is almost certain to be the most wasteful of the Covid pandemic. Data compiled by data firm Tussell, shows only one contract was more costly and it was awarded to a range of suppliers providing mixed services. The government previously estimated that £85m worth of PPE secured under the contract would not be used, which is approximately 6% of the true total.

Grade II cottages dismantled to make way for road,"Formal planning permission for the link between the A421 eastbound carriageway and the A1 northbound carriageway at the Black Cat roundabout was approved by the Secretary of State for Transport in August 2022. To build the approved route, National Highways said it needed to remove the cottages but would preserve items of heritage such as a bread oven door, structural beams, two fireplace lintels and internal fixtures and fittings. A National Highways spokesperson said: ""Since taking ownership of Brook Cottages in August 2023, we have worked with Historic England and Bedford Borough Council, conducting in-depth surveys to evaluate the historical significance and structural condition of the property. ""These surveys have revealed that the structural integrity of the building has deteriorated over a number of years and as a whole is deemed to be of low historic value. ""As a result, we have agreed with Historic England and Bedford Borough Council that Brook Cottages should not be relocated once dismantled."" Work will begin on Monday and is expected to take four weeks to complete. Work to dismantle the site was met with anger from residents who commented on a National Highways Facebook announcement to express disappointment. One person questioned why the cottages had been ""neglected to the point where they can no longer be saved"". Another said: ""These old buildings are part of our national heritage and so many have been lost to development over the last 50 years or so. ""When are we going to realise that these historic buildings are irreplaceable?"" Historic England has been approached for comment. Follow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Landlords must apply for planning permission to convert homes into HMOs for more than six people, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. However, in areas where there is evidence HMOs are causing a detrimental impact, the council can impose licensing conditions or, using an Article 4 direction, require planning permission to be sought. Mr Shaw added some parts of East Durham were already covered by selective licensing schemes but low property values, anti-social behaviour and increased crime rates were being ""further exacerbated by the proliferation of HMOs"". He said: ""We all know HMOs provide much-needed housing, but we need to look at and understand the impact."" The council's head of planning and housing, Michael Kelleher, said it had introduced specific measures in Durham City because there were a high number of such properties. In East Durham, there is a very low proportion of HMOs and therefore we cannot justify applying to government for an Article 4 direction in this area,"" he said.

Hairy Bikers fan makes knitted doll for Dave Day,"Retired police officer Ms Moth, 65, said she had watched their TV shows, bought all their recipe books, and attended live shows in Birmingham and London. She said she hoped to give the doll to Mr Myers widow Lili or his fellow Hairy Biker Si King, or alternatively she would donate the doll to the events organisers so they could auction it off for charity. Up to 20,000 people are expected to join the Dave Day procession to Myers' home town of Barrow-in-Furness. Saturdays memorial ride will culminate in celebrations in the town and will raise money for NSPCC Childline and The Institute of Cancer Research.

Harry and Meghan painted as royals from history,"A Welsh artist has unveiled a new series of pieces including a depiction of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex as historical royals. Dan Llywelyn Hall has produced 10 new portraits inspired by royalty throughout history for the Society of Antiquaries as part of an new exhibition in London. Prince Harry is depicted as Charles Edward Stuart, known as Bonnie Prince Charlie, while Meghan is portrayed as Dame Elizabeth Grey, Queen of England by marriage. Mr Llywelyn Hall said he sees the ""subject of royalty utterly irresistible and rich succour for art"". He added: ""In Harry's case, I have entered the story before he met Meghan - the young party-goer with his future very much in the balance, a bit like the Bonnie Prince I have likened him to. ""I thought putting Meghan in the role of the White Queen, who was a Queen Consort and possibly the most influential 'outsider' in royal history, might have a fine irony to it and not necessarily beyond the realms of reality."" The exhibition, titled The Reign, marks 150 years of the society at Burlington House in London. The pieces will be auctioned to support the cataloguing and digitisation of about 25,000 prints and drawings from the 18th and 19th centuries. Speaking to Radio Wales Breakfast, Mr Llywelyn Hall spoke of his inspiration for each of the pieces. ""It seemed that these figures caught on the knife edge of public opinion were ideal for drawing comparisons from distant monarchs - like the exiled princes and princesses of the past, that lurk in the background but are still irrevocably tied to the job."" The Reign opens to the public at Burlington House on 28 June with an auction on 4 July."
Harry loses bid to name Murdoch in hacking claim,"In court documents, a lawyer for the Duke of Sussex argued it could be inferred that Mr Murdoch ""was aware of the nature and extent of NGN's wrongdoing"" by virtue of his ""dominant position"" at NGN. But their request to expand the case was denied, with the judge ruling that allegations against ""trophy targets"" including Mr Murdoch added ""nothing material"" to the case. Prince Harry's lawyers ""cannot resist adding more and more detail to the claim, as more and more missing pieces of the jigsaw are found, with a view to having the fullest possible picture to put before the court and be the subject of journalists reports and judicial findings,"" he said. But ""the trial is not an inquiry,"" he concluded as he denied some of the attempts to expand its scope before the hearing of the claims is expected to begin in January next year. NGN said: ""At a hearing in March 2024, the claimants sought to introduce wide-ranging allegations into their pleadings. ""NGN argued that a number of these were irrelevant to the fair and just determination of claims and had nothing to do with seeking compensation for victims of phone hacking or unlawful information gathering. ""The court in its judgment today has thoroughly vindicated NGN's position and did not give permission to introduce large and significant portions of the amendments."" Prince Harry and other claimants said: ""The claimants are pleased that the court has today granted them permission to amend their case in relation to a number of significant issues vigorously opposed by NGN. ""The expanded case will now be determined at trial in January 2025."" The News of the World was shut down in 2011 after widespread allegations of phone hacking. NGN has since settled multiple claims with high-profile figures."
Head teacher in court over 'abuse of power',"The woman who made the allegations shared details of messages on X (formerly Twitter), phone calls and classroom interactions during her evidence. She told the court the contact became more frequent and culminated in a message in March 2022, when Mr Hill told her he had fallen in love with her.

Helicopter pilot's widow 'utterly betrayed' by MoD,"Mrs Macnaughton said her husband's stage four cancer diagnosis in February 2023 ""came out of nowhere"", and it took doctors a couple of weeks to recognise it as angiosarcoma. ""None of us could understand what was happening,"" she said. ""He couldn't understand what was happening and he didn't want to die. ""It was an incredibly traumatic and horrific time for everybody, including my kids who were watching this giant of a man just dissolve."" She said the family has been left feeling ""utterly betrayed"". ""They were so proud of Kai. They expected the RAF to look after him and they feel utterly bereft,"" she said. Sqn Ldr Macnaughton spent 30 years serving with the RAF and during his time, flew thousands of hours in Puma helicopters as a navigator and later worked as a pilot in Chinook helicopters. He was still serving at the time of his death. Lawyers now claim that toxic fumes were circulated in helicopter cabins and then ingested by crews, like Sqn Ldr Macnaughton. The fact that serving and former pilots and aircrew are taking legal action against the MoD was first reported by The Times in May. Angiosarcoma is a rare type of cancer which can start almost anywhere inside the soft tissue of the body, including muscles, fat, ligaments, tendons and blood vessels, according to the NHS. It can develop hereditarily, after exposure to radiation, and following occupational exposure to carcinogens. Mrs Macnaughton concluded that it was ""very likely"" that his condition was caused as a result of exposure to ""something in his service life."" Jonathan Dingle, a barrister from the Taunton-based law firm, Normanton Chambers, told the BBC that they believe fumes coming out of some helicopters - including the Wessex and Sea King - contained benzine carcinogens, which can cause cancer. He said that people who had worked on these helicopters had come forward with different types of cancer. ""These recirculated through the body of the helicopters causing - we believe - cancers to grow in all sorts of parts of the body of these aircrew that wouldn't be there at the age you'd expect,"" he said. ""People in their late 30s or early 40s were coming forward with all sorts of devastating cancers - some lost their lives."" He added that they now also have people coming forward who worked on the Puma - like Sqn Ldr Macnaughton. Since her husband's death, Mrs Macnaughton has submitted a claim to the armed forces compensation scheme. She has also started a civil claim. She said that, in the future, she wants to see greater awareness of the risks, so RAF personnel can make an informed choice about whether to continue their work. She also wants personal protective equipment offered to servicemen and women, in a bid to ""mitigate exposure"" to harmful fumes and a ""well thought out"" compensation scheme for all the families affected. ""I feel some strength in being able to do something about it - that sort of spurs me on,"" Mrs Macnaughton added. ""I think Kai would want me to try and prevent other people from dying so quickly."" A spokesperson from the MoD said: ""We hugely value our service personnel and veterans and owe a debt of gratitude to all those who serve, often with great personal sacrifice. ""We continually review our policies to ensure they are aligned with good practice and protect our people from harm. ""Service personnel and veterans who believe they have suffered ill health due to service from 6 April 2005 have the existing and long standing right to apply for no-fault compensation under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme."" The MoD added it is aware of four prior claims, all of which were settled on a no-fault basis. Follow BBC Wiltshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

"Hezbollahâs plans, Israelâs threats â is either side ready for war?","Beirut, Lebanon âÂ Hezbollah is preparing for different scenarios as the low-level conflict between it and Israel threatens to spin out into something larger. Feeding the idea of Israel shifting military focus from Gaza to Lebanon have been statements from officials including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who said on Sunday that Israel is winding down operations in Rafah and will redirect to Lebanon. Serious Israeli military action on Lebanon would drag in regional and possibly international actors. Israelâs attacks to date have displaced nearly 100,000 people from their homes in south Lebanon and killed at least 435 people, some 349 of them named by Hezbollah as its members. Hezbollah appears to be sticking to its guns, matching Israeli rhetoric with its own, and intensifying its cross-border attacks â which have so far killed 15 Israeli soldiers and 10 civilians, according to Israel. The two have been trading attacks across the border since the day after Israel launched a war on Gaza on October 7, the day a Hamas-led operation in Israel killed 1,139 people, according to the AFP news agency. nan nan Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has repeated in speeches since October that his group will stop its cross-border attacks on Israel only when the latter agrees to a ceasefire in Gaza. Even if Israel turns the bulk of its military attention to Lebanon, analysts believe Hezbollah will stick to its position. âI donât think Hezbollah will accept [negotiations] in absence of a ceasefire [in Gaza],â said Amal Saad, the author of two books on Hezbollah. âThe war will be ongoing. âNasrallah has said they will keep fighting until Hamas is victorious and if Hamas is weakened and undermined then Hezbollah wonât sit on [its] hands,â she said. âThereâs a strategic objective here â¦ Hezbollah will not leave Hamas on its own.â The idea of a ceasefire seemed to have hit a snag as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâs hardline coalition partners demanded a âcomplete defeat of Hamasâ before an end to the war. However, some Israeli officials have expressed doubts about the idea of a complete defeat of Hamas, underlining that Hamas is an idea and ideas cannot be eradicated. Military spokesperson Daniel Hagari expressed such doubts on June 19, while National Security Council head Tzachi Hanegbi said the same on Tuesday, less than a week later. Whether in tacit acceptance of that idea or for other considerations, Israel is now talking about a lower-intensity phase, in which, it claims, its military would continue to target Hamas in Gaza while looking for a political alternative to the group in the enclave. A lower-intensity war in Gaza would, in theory, allow for a focus on Lebanon â though that would require the Israeli military to execute the challenging prospect of engaging on two fronts. For his part, Nasrallah has been displaying his groupâs might and standing firm. On June 19, he said his group has more than 100,000 fighters and that many heads of regional armed groups had offered more fighters to join the fight against Israel, offers he rejected as Hezbollah is âoverwhelmedâ with cadres already. A day before his speech, Hezbollah released drone footage taken over the Israeli city of Haifa, an implicit threat that the city could be targeted. Another recent video by Hezbollah showed what appears to be a series of targets inside Israel and the Mediterranean Sea. âHezbollah is displaying and simulating to Israel its options [to widen the] war â¦ [this will make Israel] understand that the repercussions are seriously costly,â Imad Salamey, a political scientist at the Lebanese American University, said. nan nan Nasrallah also threatened Cyprus, an island nation that is in the European Union but not NATO, should it support Israel in war. Cyprus responded that it does not cooperate militarily with Israel in any conflicts. âSince October 8th, Cyprus has been a key location where Israeli reservists fly into and then go on to Israel,â Seth Krummrich, a former special forces officer who is now at Global Guardian risk management firm, told Al Jazeera. Israel has used Cypriot territory for training drills in the past. The threat was Nasrallahâs way of signalling âto the European Union to refrain from supporting Israel in any way, which may implicate [its] member states,â Salamey said. While both sides escalate and lay cards on the table, Hezbollah will have a couple of contingency plans. âHezbollah most probably have a strategy ready in case of a limited, protracted war in south Lebanon and they have probably prepared a strategy in case there is a wider full-scale war,âÂ  Karim Emile Bitar, professor of international relations at University Saint Joseph in Beirut, said. A limited war would be what Salamey called a âlow-intensity asymmetric warfare of attritionâ that bleeds âthe enemy through low-cost, efficient, and effective skirmishesâ â basically a continuation of the current conflict. A full-scale war may intensify attacks across Lebanon, including on infrastructure like Beirutâs airport, as Israel did in 2006. Some analysts believe a limited ground invasion of south Lebanon is possible, though it would lead to heavy casualties on both sides. For Bitar, Hezbollah likely does not want that option. âHezbollah, as well as the Iranian regime, realises [an escalation] would be extremely risky and devastating for Lebanon,â he said. The intensified threats and military actions are running parallel to diplomatic negotiations. US Special Envoy Amos Hochstein was recently in Tel Aviv and Beirut, where he allegedly passed Hezbollah messages through Lebanese parliament speaker, and Hezbollah ally, Nabih Berri. According to unnamed Western diplomats who spoke to Axios, Hochstein told Hezbollah it would be mistaken to assume that the US could prevent Israel from starting a wider war. At the same time, Hezbollah and Israel are passing messages through French diplomats, Bitar said, seeking âa face-saving exit or strategyâ. If these negotiations could result in âassurances to Israel that Hezbollahâs allies would not be present in a 6-10km [4-6 mile] radius [from the border] and that they have no intention of using the [Hezbollahâs elite] Radwan forces to attack Israelâ Hochsteinâs efforts may bear fruit, Bitar said. The parallel tracks of diplomacy and military action are interlinked. Still, there is an oft-repeated fear that a miscalculation could force an escalation with neither side wanting to give their opponents an opportunity to declare a moral victory. A war might still be prevented, save for said miscalculation or a political decision by Israel to push ahead, based on domestic considerations. For their part, Hezbollah has stuck to their position of demanding a ceasefire as their sole precondition to stop the fighting. âWeâre in a situation where, on both sides, domestic political considerations take prevalence,â Bitar said. âHezbollah is conscious that most Lebanese, including a significant part of their own supporters, do not want a new war,â he added. âBoth parties are taking these factors into consideration however we are in a situation that is extremely volatile and any miscalculation by either side could lead to a new full-fledged [escalated conflict] in the region.â nan nan"
"Highland Council: 24,000 new homes needed over next 10 years","Highland, along with other Scottish local authorities, has been highlighting local housing issues. It follows the Scottish government declaring a national housing emergency in May, which was designed to formally recognise problems with the wider housing system. Highland councillors have agreed steps should be taken to develop a housing challenge action plan by the end of this year. In a report, council officials have set out potential solutions to meeting the 10-year target. Officers said the local authority's contribution to the cost was manageable within ""anticipated, planned budgets"". The report said: ""Importantly, the challenge of building this number of houses in 10 years, can be met if a number of strategic objectives are achieved."" The council has built an average of more than 500 affordable properties annually over the last 10 years. Officials have suggested a number of possible ways of raising funds. These include having the council's £365m housing debt written off to free up investment which could be put towards increasing the number of affordable homes. They said a significant element of the debt was historical, inherited from former district councils before local government reorganisations in the 1990s. It is associated with housebuilding programmes to meet demand from the hydro-electric and North Sea oil and gas industries. Highland Council wrote to the Levelling Up, Housing and Communities Secretary Michael Gove in May to request a meeting to discuss the UK government partially writing off the debt. A similar letter has been sent to deputy leader of the Labour Party, Angela Raynor. Highland Council has also been exploring how it might attract investment from pension funds. The report said: ""Pension fund managers are very keen to invest in housing, it is a low risk, long term sustainable investment and there are various models currently on the market which are worth further consideration. ""Officers have had initial discussions with one private sector pension investor to understand their investment approach and appetite, and further follow up discussions are planned."" The green freeport itself could be another source of funding. The Highlands' freeport was announced last January, and a Japanese subsea cables company already has plans to open factory there. Freeports are special economic zones able to offer tax incentives and lower tariffs to help them attract businesses to set up in their areas. Highland Council said the Inverness and Cromarty Firth freeports' non-domestic rates concession could generate an estimated £550m over 25 years. But officials said there could be competing demands for the investment to be used for roads and schools. Highland Council says the area needs an extra 24,000 houses over the next 10 years. New homes are needed to address a long-standing shortage of affordable homes. But there is now also an urgent need to have accommodation available for people filling an expected 8,400 jobs to be created by the new Inverness and Cromarty Firth Green Freeport. The council said under the current rate of building it would take over 20 years to reach the required number of new homes. It said about £2.8bn of extra investment was needed to accelerate the construction programme. Highland, along with other Scottish local authorities, has been highlighting local housing issues.

Strategic director for growth and regeneration, David Shepherd, said: Were passionate about restoring the George Hotel to its former glory and are excited to see the next phases of construction begin. As always with any listed building, its a complex restoration project and we are working with contractors on these specialist works; we will be keeping residents updated with progress on the next phase in due course. A three-storey block will be demolished and a new structure built, though the historic facade will be preserved. The council bought the building in 2020, and initially planned to convert it into a museum about rugby league, as the sport was founded in the hotel in 1895. It was later decided that this use would not be financially viable. nan nan"
Historic theatre set to be live music venue,"A 1930 theatre which became a bingo hall is now set to revert to being a live music venue. The Adelphi Theatre on Bath Road in Slough, had previously featured performances from The Beatles, Roy Orbison and Jimi Hendrix. Since 1973 the site had been a bingo hall, until Buzz Bingo closed in April 2023. A post on social media from Buzz Bingo said: Were so sad to say goodbye but so grateful for all your support."" The Adelphi was bought by the council for £4.6 million in 2018, but was sold off in January last year to ease the councils debt pressures. The new owner of The Adelphi wants to bring its performing pedigree back by renaming it the Crystal Grand and launching a bid to host live music inside. A businessman has applied to hold live music at the theatre from 9:00 to 23:00 GMT every day, with recorded music until 01:00 each night. He has also applied to sell alcohol until 00.30 every night, and serve food. Permission has been submitted in a licensing application to Slough Borough Council. Anyone can comment on the application by emailing or writing to the council by Tuesday 2 July. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

Holmfirth: Fatal 1944 flood anniversary marked with walking trail,"Monday marks 80 years since the Whit Monday 1944 flood in Holmfirth, which saw an ""incredible downpour"" which wrecked buildings and infrastructure. The new trail, which launched on Saturday, follows key locations along the flood's route. Holmfirth Library is also hosting an exhibition about the flood. The walk begins at Blackpool Bridge on the moors above the villages of Holme and Holmbridge. It later heads to Bilberry and Digley reservoirs, Holmbridge, Hinchliffe Mill, Perseverance Place and Upperbridge before finishing at Holmfirth Library. Holmfirth Library said the trail provides ""an introduction to the course of the 1944 flood and to the many attractive and fascinating locations along the stretch of the upper River Holme"". The storm which caused flash flooding is said to have hit just after 18:00 BST on an otherwise dry day. According to an account of the event on the Kirklees Council website, ""the incredible downpour rapidly swelled the water level, causing a wall of water to gush down towards the Holme.

Home blocked by scaffolding after repair delay,"A father-of-four said he felt ""hopeless"" after scaffolding had been left on his family home for months without any building work taking place. Baha Uddin, from Slough, Berkshire, said the structure was put up around his council house in March after he reported problems with the roof. But the tenant said no work had taken place in three months, leaving the family unable to open windows in the summer. Slough Borough Council did not explain the delay but apologised and said work would be completed ""within the next couple of weeks"". Mr Uddin said the scaffolding meant he could not let his children outside in the garden to play. I reported problems because this house is cold and mouldy,"" he told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). ""Finally they found something is wrong with the roof, then the people who were going to do the work found another serious problem."" But Mr Uddin said no-one had explained what the problems were, or when they were going to be fixed. He said: Ive called the people who are supposed to do the job. ""A guy comes every week and checks the scaffolding, but no-one comes and does the work. I feel hopeless. A Slough Borough Council spokesperson said the scaffolding had been erected for ""longer than we anticipated"" and apologised for the delay. The authority did not say what issues it had found with the property. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram.

Hospital decaf pilot aims to reduce falls,"Caffeine, a natural stimulant found in tea and coffee, can exacerbate bladder sensitivity, leading to frequent urination and disruptions in daily life, the Tust said. It said the switch to decaf drinks would lead to ""significant improvements in bladder control, reduced bathroom visits, and a lowered risk of falls, particularly at night"". It said the change could also lead to improvements in sleep, reduced indigestion and help prevent headaches and dehydration. Deputy chief nurse Victoria Hazeldine said: Our pilot is designed to help patients manage their bladder health more effectively. ""By promoting the benefits of decaffeinated beverages, we aim to reduce the negative impact of caffeine on the bladder, reduce falls and improve overall wellbeing. ""The research carried out so far has been showing up to a 30% reduction in falls. The trial is due to run until the end of 2024.

Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust is trialling the move from caffeinated to decaffeinated drinks on two wards.

Hospital failed man who fell to his death - coroner,"In a prevention of future deaths report, Essex coroner Sonia Hayes said there had been ""failings in the care and safeguarding"" by the trust which contributed to Mr Deeley being able to take his own life. Mr Deeley was an inpatient in Southend's acute medical ward and awaiting an assessment by the Mental Health Liaison team from Essex Partnership University Trust (EPUT). A jury concluded in May that there had been several issues in Mr Deeley's care. It noted there had been inconsistencies in completing the medical ward's enhanced observation form on the day before his death. Also, after a previous suicide attempt in December 2021, there was insufficient detail from Southend Hospital in his discharge letter. The discharge paperwork from the mental health team was sent to the wrong GP address. The coroner highlighted there had been confusion from the medical trust about what was required to ensure a patient waiting on a Mental Health Act assessment could be put under one-to-one observation. She said Mid and South Essex Trust's policy on the issue was ""confusing"". Ms Hayes said: ""There is a lacuna for patients awaiting Mental Health Act assessment and requiring simultaneous physical healthcare when a significant risk has been identified such that a patient may require detention for their own safety."" Matthew Hopkins, chief executive of Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust said a full investigation took place following Mr Deeley's death. He said: ""We have improved our policies and procedures to ensure the safe supervision of mental health patients on our wards. Immediate action was taken to secure the windows and appropriate action has been taken to ensure that our windows are safe for all patients. Paul Scott, CEO of EPUT, said the trust would look at the coroner's recommendations and was ""committed to ensuring patients receive the right care at the right time"". He said the trust's mental health liaison teams worked closely to ensure patients ""receive the most appropriate mental health support to meet their individual needs"".

Hospitals warn of disruption as doctors strike,"NHS leaders in Yorkshire warned of disruption as junior doctors joined a national five-day strike in their long-running dispute with the government. Hospitals across the region said it was likely they would be significantly affected, but the priority was to keep patients safe. Strike action by junior doctors belonging to the British Medical Association (BMA) runs from 07:00 BST on Thursday 27 June to 07:00 BST on Tuesday 2 July. The BMA has asked for a 35% pay rise, but the government has described the claim as ""unreasonable"". Routine hospital services were expected to face the most disruption because senior doctors have been drafted in to provide cover in emergency care. Outside the Friarage Hospital in Northallerton, junior doctors said the strikes were not just about restoring pay but also ensuring patients got the care they needed. Dr Tom Sharp, a GP trainee, said many of his doctor colleagues had moved to countries like New Zealand where he said they could get better pay and better conditions. The ultimate upshot of this is that the NHS, which is already struggling to meet demand, just cannot cope,"" he said. ""What that means for patients and for the public, for you and your family, is that your appointments are delayed, your operations are delayed and you don't get the care you need and that they deserve. He said that while ""a lot of our action is about pay"", it was also about ""improving conditions for doctors, which will direct our patient care and make our NHS better for us all"". ""Its really in the governments power to sit round the negotiating table and its really in the governments power now. Even with an election looming, Rishi Sunak could still commit to restoring our pay,"" he added. Meanwhile, Sarah Peters, who described herself as an F2 doctor at the Friarage, meaning she was part way through her training, added that the strikes were not just about pay, but also staff retention. You need to retain and have staff to keep staffing safe and keep patients safe, so ultimately thats why Im here, she said. In South Yorkshire, the Minor Injuries Unit at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield will be closed throughout the strike period. Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said: ""We will be prioritising patient safety and emergency care but we are likely to have considerably fewer doctors available during this time and as a consequence waiting times will be much longer than normal for less urgent conditions or injuries."" The West Yorkshire Association of Acute Trusts (WYAAT), which is a collaboration between the six hospital trusts in West Yorkshire and Harrogate, said certain resources would be protected during the strike. These are: emergency treatment; cancer care; critical care; maternity and neonatal care; trauma and patients who have waited the longest for elective surgery. Dr Richard Robinson, chief medical officer at Mid Yorkshire Teaching NHS Trust, said junior doctors were a ""truly valuable part of the workforce"" and them striking caused ""additional challenges"". He said as a result there would be fewer staff available and the trust would not be ""providing as much of that work as we would normally expect"". Like other hospital trusts in Yorkshire, Mr Robinson urged patients in a life-threatening emergency to call 999 as usual. But he asked those who have a minor injury or something less serious to contact 111, the GP or their pharmacist. Hospital trusts have also urged patients to attend planned appointments unless contacted. However, Doncaster and Bassetlaw Hospitals NHS Trust said depending on how the week progressed, ""some appointments"" may be cancelled at short notice. Industrial action by junior doctors began in December 2022, with the last strike being held in February. The union said it was taking action as there had been no credible new offer after fresh talks started in mid-May. Nearly 1.5 million appointments and operations have been cancelled because of strike action in the NHS in England at an estimated cost of £3bn. NHS England said although extensive planning and cover arrangements were in place, the strikes were expected to cause widespread disruption to routine care and difficulties with discharging patients. Professor Sir Stephen Powis, NHS England medical director, said: This new round of strike action will again hit the NHS very hard, with almost all routine care likely to be affected, and services put under significant pressure."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Patient safety will be the priority during industrial action and the NHS has prepared for these strikes in the usual way. ""NHS England is working closely with unions to discuss any patient safety concerns and ensuring safe staffing for emergency care continues to be available.""

Housing firm sorry for shoddy work and dead birds,"Residents complained about botched and stalled refurbishments on their homes. Windows were left with gaps around them or bricked up, walls and ceilings with cracks and holes and some residents said mould became so bad in their homes it caused health problems. Then earlier this month, they told BBC Radio Shropshire how contractors for the firm cut down a tree containing nesting birds and bats, some of which died as they fell. At the time, Connexus apologised but said the tree had become dangerous. Ms Woodall said a new contractor on the refurbishment project was putting things right but the work was taking time. ""It has felt, and we explained this to residents, 'one step forward, two steps back' because we've had to go back and put right work that wasn't done properly in the first instance,"" she said. In response to the tree cutting, which is under investigation by the RSPCA for potentially breaching wildlife laws, Connexus promised new protections for wildlife on the estate. ""[We will] design in swift boxes as part of the roof treatment, we've provided nest boxes to any customers who want them and we're also committing to place some hedgehog homes across the site,"" Ms Woodall said. The meeting followed calls by local councillor Andy Boddington for the provider to get together with residents to work through issues.

How Afrobeats made it to the very top of Glastonbury,"The genre has its roots in Nigeria and Ghana, and started rising rapidly in popularity in the 2010s, with early hits from artists like Fuse ODG and D'banj. It is not to be confused with ""Afrobeat"" - minus the ""s"". That is a movement created in the 1960s and 1970s by the artist and activist Fela Kuti. Kuti's musical style is a fusion of traditional African rhythms with funk, jazz and highlife. Coincidentally, Kuti himself played at Glastonbury in 1984, and this year, his son Femi Kuti played on the Pyramid Stage. But Afrobeats, with an ""s"", is a completely different sound. It is generally seen as a fusion of traditional West African musical styles with Western pop, rap and dancehall. ""Afrobeat spoke to a much older audience,"" said DJ Edu, who hosts BBC 1Xtra's AfroSounds show. ""Afrobeats has been driven a lot by social media,"" he said, adding that young people, travelling to different parts of the world, also helped spread the sound. There were challenges, of course. DJ Edu said that a lot of people who started out making Afrobeats were not clued up about the music industry. ""They were just kids making music from their bedrooms, not worrying about streaming or royalties. That was the big problem, there was no structure,"" he said. But as bigger artists started making headway, younger ones were able to learn from them and chart their own route in the industry, he added. DJs in the UK started fusing pop music with Nigerian and Ghanaian beats, taking the sounds to new audiences. Songs from the genre regularly started crossing into the mainstream, with its first big global success being the release of Oliver Twist by the artist D'banj in 2012. The song made the top 10 on the official UK Singles Chart and was number two in the UK R&B Charts. It is often described as the first time Afrobeats really took hold in the UK. From then on, Afrobeats quickly spread around the world. It has often been described as one of Africa's biggest cultural exports. ""We've been waiting for the globalisation of Afrobeats, and it's happening now,"" Starr said, speaking ahead of her Glastonbury performance. ""But its not just what you're seeing today. It's years and generations of musicians and hard work thats made it what it is now."" TikTok and YouTube - where many people discover new music - have played a big part in taking Afrobeats to new audiences in the UK, the US and beyond. One example is Nigerian artist CKay's Love Nwantiti, which went viral on the app and became the most Shazam-ed song in the world in 2021. Songs by singers Davido, Burna Boy and Wizkid have also gained popularity through their TikTok dance routines. Collaborations with the likes of Beyoncé, Drake and Justin Bieber have also helped lift the Afrobeats scene to new heights. For example, Drake featured Wizkid on 2016's One Dance - which helped put a spotlight on the singer and the genre he represents. In the summer of 2023, Burna Boy made history when he became the first African artist to headline a stadium show in the UK in front of a sold-out crowd of 60,000 at the London Stadium. ""The genre's rise has been nothing short of meteoric,"" Sheniece Charway, YouTube's artists' relations manager for black music and culture, told BBC News. ""Afrobeats has ignited a global revolution, and it's captivating trajectory shows no sign of slowing."" ""Popular music is pop music and Afrobeats has become popular music globally,"" she added. ""We are seeing the likes of Wizkid, Libianca and Burna Boy all having global success, which shows that their audience is everywhere."" In a sign of the genre's huge global popularity, it has been included as a category in a number of major awards. Billboard in the US recently added an Afrobeats category, with Burna Boy and fellow Nigerian star Rema both recognised at the event in November. Burna Boy, who has also been the recipient of a Grammy, dedicated his award ""to Africa and every artist coming out of Africa now"". Meanwhile Rema won a gong for his near-ubiquitous song Calm Down, which has smashed multiple streaming and chart records. The track, which featured Selena Gomez, became the first African artist-led track to hit a billion streams on Spotify. Accepting the Billboard award for best Afrobeats song, Rema thanked his fans and called the prize ""a celebration of unity and the global domination of Afrobeats"". The MTV VMAs, Grammys and American Music Awards have also recently added the category of best Afrobeats. DJ Edu says this recognition has meant a lot to Afrobeats artists. ""[It] shows there's a light at the end of the tunnel for this music,"" he said. For Starr, part of the reason for Afrobeats' huge growth is the fact the sound is overwhelmingly positive. ""Afrobeats is enjoyment. You have to enjoy yourself, you have to be at a club or at a party to make the music that people want to dance to. And we like to dance,"" she said. ""I feel like that's why it's our time. I think God has made it like that - because we make positive music, we make high vibrational music."" Meanwhile in the UK, British artists have been developing their own style and sound, such as Afroswing, which merges Afrobeats with dancehall, grime, rap and R&B. Grammy award winning producer Jae5, based in the UK, has produced mega-hits for Burna Boy and Dave. ""The main influence that I'm infusing things with is the African culture,"" he told BBC News. ""I'll make a hip hop song and it will still have a lot of percussive elements. I might make a ballad and I'll have more percussive elements than a normal track. So the African sound is what is continuous in my music. The groove of Africa is very different to the groove over here."" Having swept the globe and landed at Glastonbury, what's next for Afrobeats? Jae5 can see it going from strength to strength, as people are ""infatuated"" by the sound. ""The world is huge and Afrobeats has so much space to grow,"" he said. ""And the fact that [fans] are receiving it in the way they are is amazing."" For more on the rise of Afrobeats, listen back to Black, African and British on BBC Radio 4. Additional reporting by Mark Savage. On Sunday evening, Afrobeats megastar Burna Boy will fire up Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage. While he has played at the UK's biggest festival before, this is his first time on the famous main stage, which has been Glastonbury's focal point for decades. Fellow Afrobeats star Ayra Starr also performed on the Pyramid Stage on Saturday, while Tems had a slot on the Other Stage. From West Africa to the world stage, Afrobeats has risen rapidly to dominate playlists and radio. On Spotify, the Afrobeats genre has grown by 1,200% since 2017. But with its artists now performing at the very top of the UK's biggest festival, it feels like another threshold has been crossed. ""It's our time,"" Starr told BBC News. ""Its been a long time coming and we deserve this."" So what is Afrobeats all about, and how has it taken off?

Burna Boy, who has also been the recipient of a Grammy, dedicated his award ""to Africa and every artist coming out of Africa now"". Meanwhile Rema won a gong for his near-ubiquitous song Calm Down, which has smashed multiple streaming and chart records. The track, which featured Selena Gomez, became the first African artist-led track to hit a billion streams on Spotify. Accepting the Billboard award for best Afrobeats song, Rema thanked his fans and called the prize ""a celebration of unity and the global domination of Afrobeats"". The MTV VMAs, Grammys and American Music Awards have also recently added the category of best Afrobeats. DJ Edu says this recognition has meant a lot to Afrobeats artists. ""[It] shows there's a light at the end of the tunnel for this music,"" he said. For Starr, part of the reason for Afrobeats' huge growth is the fact the sound is overwhelmingly positive. ""Afrobeats is enjoyment. You have to enjoy yourself, you have to be at a club or at a party to make the music that people want to dance to. And we like to dance,"" she said. ""I feel like that's why it's our time. I think God has made it like that - because we make positive music, we make high vibrational music."" Meanwhile in the UK, British artists have been developing their own style and sound, such as Afroswing, which merges Afrobeats with dancehall, grime, rap and R&B. Grammy award winning producer Jae5, based in the UK, has produced mega-hits for Burna Boy and Dave. ""The main influence that I'm infusing things with is the African culture,"" he told BBC News. ""I'll make a hip hop song and it will still have a lot of percussive elements. I might make a ballad and I'll have more percussive elements than a normal track. So the African sound is what is continuous in my music. The groove of Africa is very different to the groove over here."" Having swept the globe and landed at Glastonbury, what's next for Afrobeats? Jae5 can see it going from strength to strength, as people are ""infatuated"" by the sound. ""The world is huge and Afrobeats has so much space to grow,"" he said. ""And the fact that [fans] are receiving it in the way they are is amazing."" For more on the rise of Afrobeats, listen back to Black, African and British on BBC Radio 4.

How Israelâs raids on Jenin only fuel Palestinian resistance,"On May 21, Amr Musara went out to report on Israelâs raid on the Jenin refugee camp in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. The 25-year-old videographer was working with three Palestinian colleagues â all visibly identified as press. The Israeli army fired at them. Musara was shot in the back as his colleagues hit the ground to take cover. When the soldiers stopped shooting, Musara was rushed to the nearest hospital. âI thought I was going to die,â Musara told Al Jazeera over the phone from his home where he is recovering from his wounds. Musara said Israel routinely shoots at journalists across the West Bank. âThey targeted us in the same way they targeted Shireen,â Musara said. Israeli forces shot and killed Al Jazeera correspondent Shireen Abu Akleh while she was reporting on a raid in Jenin in May 2022. A United Nations investigative body found the killing was deliberate. nan nan âThere was no danger [for the Israeli soldiers] around us. There were no resistance fighters. âThey just shot at us.â Since it launched its war on Gaza on October 7, Israel has killed 516 Palestinians in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. According to an investigation by the Palestinian human rights group Al-Haq and London-based research group Forensic Architecture, Israel typically sends undercover soldiers into West Bank cities to monitor and assess the area before the army or special forces arrive. Last week, several undercover Israeli soldiers pretending to be Palestinians came into Jenin and took up positions among the homes to survey the camp. The next morning, the army stormed Jeninâs refugee camp with tanks, jeeps and bulldozers. The bulldozers were sent in to destroy shops, roads and homes, journalist and camp resident Atef Abdul Rub said. âThey started shooting at a school, â¦ at the students and at the teachers,â Abdul Rub told Al Jazeera. Ten civilians were killed during Israelâs latest incursion into the camp, including a teenage boy and a doctor. Israel has raided the Jenin refugee camp over and over for years, ostensibly to root out an umbrella organisation of armed groups known as the Jenin Brigades, which opposes Israelâs occupation. Israeli forces typically destroy entire neighbourhoods, claiming they are harbouring fighters. Civilians are punished in the process â killed, arrested or made homeless, residents and activists told Al Jazeera. âWhat I saw in Jenin camp is like Gaza on a smaller scale,â said Zaid Shuabi, a Palestinian human rights organiser in the West Bank. âYou donât see roads because theyâre destroyed. The infrastructure, â¦ the sewage and electricity system and the water pipes and telecommunication networks are damaged.â Since January 2023, 88 people have been killed in the Jenin camp and 104 structures have been destroyed, according to the UN. Since 2021, a new cohort of Palestinian armed groups has emerged across the West Bank. In the Jenin camp, the Jenin Brigades has clashed with Israeli troops during dozens of raids. The group is loosely composed of fighters linked to Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) and Fatah, according to Tahani Mustafa, an expert on Israel-Palestine for the International Crisis Group (ICG), a think tank in Belgium. âThese groups [in Jenin] started as a community defence mechanism, so the more violent Israelâs raids got and the more systemic [they got], the bigger these groups grew,â Mustafa told Al Jazeera. She said the young men who join these groups are reacting to Israelâs deepening occupation and are disillusioned with the Palestinian Authority (PA), which administers the occupied West Bank and is viewed as an Israeli auxiliary by many Palestinians. nan nan The PA has engaged in security cooperation with Israel as part of the 1993 Oslo Accords, which it was born out of. Some senior Fatah officials in the PA back and finance some Fatah factions in the Jenin Brigades to increase their leverage in any future power struggle to control the PA, Mustafa added. The ICG hasÂ long warned of a violent succession struggle in the PA when President Mohamad Abbas, 88, steps aside or dies. Mustafa said others in the Jenin Brigades are also part of the PA security forces, which give them a monthly salary. âOriginally, when the [PA] security forces were conceived by the Americans and Israelis, the idea was to use the security forces as a way â¦ to disarm radical [fighters] and give them jobs in exchange for laying down their weapons,â she said. âNow, obviously in the context of the occupation, that isnât going to work. A lot of these guys haveÂ  jobs â a monthly salary â but still engage in resistance.â Some young men join armed groups to receive a salary. The PIJ pays its members from $1,000 to $3,000 a month, Mustafa said. The financial incentives have drawn young men from outside the camp. âWhat we have seen since last July is that a lot of these guys are coming from other localities, â¦ which then creates a contentious relationship because it is one thing if you are [a civilian] dying for [the actions] of your brother or son. âItâs another when you donât know who these guys are,â she told Al Jazeera. Shuabi said Israel punishes civilians in the camp in the hope that they will turn against the resistance fighters. He explained that, in particular, Israel intentionally destroys neighbourhoods, roads and homes as part of a broader strategy to displace Palestinians from the Jenin camp gradually. In July, a substantial Israeli operation against the camp led to the displacement of 3,000 people, according to the UN. Those who stayed in the camp faced an acute lack of services after Israel deliberately destroyed water pumps and electricity grids. Shuabi believes that Israelâs strategy is backfiring. More young Palestinians are joining resistance groups to avenge loved ones or to defend their families and communities from Israelâs raids, he said. âFamilies of martyrs â even if they are feeling pain â understand why their brothers [or sons] or other family members are getting involved in the resistance,â he told Al Jazeera. âEven if theyâre not a member of the resistance, theyâre being targeted. They figure that they might as well die with pride by being a member of the resistance.â nan nan"

How a site on the Mendips helped fool the Nazis,"Hidden at the top of the Mendip Hills are the remains of a top secret 'city' from World War Two. Black Down was one of 12 Starfish sites around Bristol, and the first of 800 in the UK. The goal was to trick German pilots into bombing open countryside instead of cities. Across the UK, decoy sites - codenamed Starfish sites - helped to divert thousands of tonnes of bombs - saving thousands of lives. Mike Harvey hosts guided walks up to the site on Black Down, near Cheddar, on behalf of The Mendip Society. He said a ""huge number of people"" do not know the history of the site, which is one of the ""best preserved Starfish"" locations in the country. ""There's 1,700 earthwork tumps, and three brick-built bunkers,"" he said. ""It's a fascinating history of how this piece of landscape became a dummy for Bristol to try and divert enemy bombs."" Starfish sites were part of a nationwide programme, introduced after the German bombing raids on Coventry in 1940. Overseen by Royal Engineer Colonel John Turner, sites would be placed strategically around cities, ports, railway stations and military bases. Experts at Shepperton Film Studios were brought in to design lights and fires to mimic failed black-outs and already bombed locations. These special effects were then controlled on-site by volunteers, inside brick-built bunkers. Mr Harvey said ""Starfish"" comes from the initials 'S.F' for Special Fire. ""The site was controlled by a nearby field telephone, where a sergeant would give the signal that German bombers were coming,"" he said. ""Various lighting effects would be switched on, created by tanks of diesel oil and dripping rolls of Creosote. ""All designed as much as possible to look like a burning city."" Black Down also had an enclosure of rocket launchers near Mendip Raceway, known as Z guns, said Mr Harvey. ""Huge numbers of rockets were sent up by these Z guns to burst in and around the German aircraft,"" Mr Harvey added. ""Partly to give the illusion that they were being shot at. ""But also spooling out wire, which would get caught in wings and engines and hopefully bring a few down."" Bristol endured five months of bombing raids between November 1940 and April 1941. Almost 1,300 people died and 1,303 were seriously injured. Mr Harvey said the Starfish site at Black Down was possibly not the most successful due to Bristol being so distinctive. ""It did attract some bombs,"" he said. ""One of the bunkers has the remains of an old crater where a 500lb landmine went in and shook the foundations of the bunker. ""Overall thousands of tonnes of bombs were diverted by the various Starfish sites. ""Equally thousands of lives were probably saved. ""How effective they were is difficult to say because they were all top secret."" Mr Harvey added: ""It's the human story behind it. ""The machinery and the ingenuity is one thing but it's the people that lived through it. ""One guy down at the Uphill Starfish site, when the electrics failed, went out on his hands and knees and lit the fires by hand. ""He was awarded a gallantry medal for being in the line of fire.""

How candidates are using TikTok to shape election,"Reform candidate for Taunton and Wellington, Charles Hansard, has garnered hundreds of thousands of views since he first started posting on 1 June. Describing the channel as ""a bit of a vanity project"", he told the BBC: ""You mustnt take it too seriously, to be honest. ""You mustnt go oh were going to be elected because all these people like me - it doesnt work like that. The only poll is the poll on 4 July. Independent Abi McGuire, standing in the Wells and Mendip Hills constituency in Somerset, has been on Tik Tok for almost a year. ""Because we're an independent campaign and not from a political party, it was really important to get our messaging out really early,"" she said. ""One of the ways to do that was social media, in bitesize chunks, so its sort of like feeding people slowly so they can start to build-up a picture of what were trying to explain, and that takes time."" In a bid to grab viewers' attention, some candidate and party TikTok accounts have been trying out the latest trends. So far in this election, we've seen the main parties favouring a meme-like approach - think loud, jarring soundtracks, heavy editing and templates that have gone viral elsewhere on the platform. But this is not an approach favoured by everyone. Mr Hansard said his videos were ""quite simple"", adding: ""Im quite a serious individual, Im not a jazzy kind of guy. ""So my message is, as an ex-soldier, clear and concise  thats what were doing, thats where were going, thats what weve done'."" Jake Shepton, who runs Ms McGuire's social media accounts, said TikTok had ""almost become a race"" between parties to go viral. He said: ""I think its funny but I dont think its necessarily appropriate because I think turning your campaign into a meme just to try to get more young people to vote for you is morally right. ""Thats why Ive never pursued turning Abi into a meme  I want her to be genuine and share her message without having to become a meme. The Green Party's digital communications officer Marcus Cain said that to go viral teams had to be ""really on it"", adding that their campaign aimed to mix ""the less serious"" with the ""more serious"". He described this approach as ""really helpful"" because if a clip ""performs really well and it draws a lot of people to our account theyll hopefully see the other stuff were putting out as well."" ""Thats the reason weve not gone down the route some of the other parties have of just doing really tongue in cheek stuff and nothing else,"" he said. Green co-leader Carla Denyer, standing in Bristol Central, features heavily on the party's TikTok page. The party's strategy on the platform, Mr Cain said, was focused on two main strands - using content from pre-planned events such as the campaign launch in Bristol, and reacting to developing news topics using clips from interviews with traditional broadcasters. He added that X (formerly Twitter) had become ""less useful"" to the party since its takeover by Elon Musk. The party has, however, seen ""huge growth"" on Instagram. Everyone the BBC spoke to for this story said one of the driving forces behind their decision to take the campaign to TikTok was the hope content would reach younger audiences, particularly those voting for the first time. Mr Shepton said: ""Targeting people like non-voters or people who have been disengaged has been so important, particularly on TikTok, as well as first-time voters."" Mr Cain added: ""The youth vote is really important, particularly in Bristol. Carla is doing great work and is really confident in that sort of stuff, which we really try to utilise. But while the platform is hugely targeted towards young people, and candidates have seen it reaching the under-30s, they are not the only people using the platform. Monty Durnam, social media assistant for Mr Hansard's campaign, told the BBC: ""I look at the analytics and actually weve got a lot of middle-aged viewers, a lot of engagement does come from that older audience."" We reached out to other candidates across the West Country using TikTok this election - Taunton and Wellington Liberal Democrat candidate Gideon Amos and Chippenham Labour Party candidate Ravi Venkatesh - but did not receive a response.

How do heat and cold-health alerts work?,"Run by the UKHSA and the Met Office, the weather health alert system for England was introduced in June 2023. It includes both heat-health alerts and cold-health alerts. Heat-health alerts are typically issued between 1 June and 30 September, and cold-health alerts between 1 November and 30 March. The system issues warnings to members of the public, and sends guidance directly to NHS England, the government and other healthcare professionals during periods of adverse weather. Alerts are categorised according to severity and include: The system was designed to help reduce illness and deaths by improving communication between the public and relevant bodies during periods of extreme weather. The level of alert is based on Met Office forecasts and data. There are four levels ranging from green (least severe) to red (most severe): Green Green is the normal level, when advice is given on how people should prepare to respond if temperatures rise or fall. Yellow Yellow alerts are issued during periods of hot or cold weather that are only likely to affect those who are particularly vulnerable, for example the elderly, or those with existing health conditions. Amber Amber alerts are issued in situations that could potentially put the whole population at risk. The NHS may see increased demand on GPs and ambulances, for example. Travel disruption is also likely. Red A red alert is the most severe. It is issued in situations when hot or cold weather would be a significant risk to life, for even the healthy population, and could lead to failures of critical national infrastructure, such as power outages or roads and rail lines being closed. As the body gets hotter, blood vessels open up. This leads to lower blood pressure and makes the heart work harder to push the blood around the body. This can cause mild symptoms such as an itchy heat rash or swollen feet as blood vessels become leaky. At the same time, sweating leads to the loss of fluids and salt and, crucially, the balance between them in the body changes. This, combined with the lowered blood pressure, can lead to heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Symptoms include: If blood pressure drops too far, the risk of heart attacks rises.

Hull funeral probe: Anger over police chief claims,"In a message to families from the police, seen by the BBC, they were told the force would ""continue to do everything"" to get justice in the Legacy case. The message also made reference to the allegations made in the national media and said it would have ""no impact"" on the Legacy inquiry. Tristan Essex, whose grandmother Jessie Stockdale was among 35 bodies found at the funeral home in Hessle Road, said he was shocked by the report but ""not surprised"". He said: ""This adds further insult to our trauma. We are not surprised. Our loved ones have never been treated with dignity"".

"IS: A persistent danger, 10 years since its peak","A senior Whitehall official in London describes the status of the group as ""down but not out"". Its dwindling core leadership remains in Syria, but IS has expanded its franchise across several continents. The bulk of attacks carried out in its name are now in sub-Saharan Africa. In Europe and the Middle East, its most dangerous branch is considered to be IS-Khorasan Province, widely blamed for this years mass casualty attacks in Moscow and Kerman in Iran. IS-Khorasan Province, or ISKP, is based in Afghanistan and north-west Pakistan, from where it is waging an insurgency against Afghanistans ruling Taliban. nan That may sound odd, given that the Taliban have imposed their own, extreme version of Shariah, banning women from jobs or even a proper education, as well as reintroducing punishments such as stoning to death. Yet the Taliban and IS are bitter rivals - and after 20 years as insurgents, the Taliban are now finding themselves the poachers turned gamekeepers. When IS had a physical base - its caliphate in Syria and Iraq - it was able to attract recruits who found it easy to fly to Turkey, catch a bus to the border and then get smuggled across into Syria. These recruits mostly lacked both military experience or any real understanding of the civil war that was tearing Syria apart. Many had a background of petty crime and drug-taking back home. These included four men from West London, nicknamed The Beatles by their captives, who ended up guarding and torturing Western aid workers and journalists. Today one is dead and the others are in prison, including two now serving life sentences in a US supermax jail. But IS is still inciting attacks via its online media. Its two principal causes right now are calls for revenge for Israels nine-month long assault on Gaza and the  imprisonment of IS women and children in grim, flyblown camps in northern Syria. Like al-Qaeda, which has also not gone away, IS thrives on disorder, despair and poor governance by whoever is in charge. In parts of Africa, there are large pockets of all three. In recent years, the countries of the Sahel belt  notably Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso  have all experienced military coups, leading to increased instability. French, American and EU troops that were helping local governments to keep the jihadist threat at bay, not always successfully, have largely been kicked out or replaced by Russian mercenaries. IS now has five branches in Africa, which it refers to as Wilayaat (provinces), spread across West Africa, the Lake Chad area, Democratic Republic of Congo and northern Mozambique. Here too, IS is in direct competition - and often confrontation - with al-Qaeda. IS boasts that it is expanding both its operations and the areas under its control. Certainly it appears to be more agile than the governments it is fighting, often mounting surprise deadly raids and ambushes that kill scores of troops or villagers in remote areas. Africa has not turned out to be the geographical magnet for international jihadists that Syria was 10 years ago. There is no pipeline of volunteers flocking there in the way there was to the Turkish-Syrian border or before that, to the Tribal Territories of north-west Pakistan. But the IS franchise still has plenty of recruits, mostly young, local men, who see an almost total lack of opportunities elsewhere. The small, localised but extremely violent conflicts in Africa may be thousands of miles away from Europes shores, but as the jihadist threat increases, it will inevitably propel more migrants from Africa to seek a safer life in Europe. nan At the height of its strength, in the mid-2010s, IS was able to mount spectacular, mass-casualty attacks in Europe, such as the attack on the Bataclan concert hall in Paris in 2015 that left 130 people dead. Killers were trained up and dispatched from Syria, crossing multiple borders with ease and having no trouble in accessing powerful automatic weapons such as Kalashnikovs from the Balkans. Since then, and after numerous attacks in Europes cities, intelligence-sharing between police forces and security agencies has improved considerably. UK officials now believe it would be much harder  although not impossible  for IS or al-Qaeda to mount the sort of  highly planned and co-ordinated attack like the London bombings of 2005 or the Bataclan in 2015. Instead, they worry most about solo operators: self-motivated extremists and sociopaths who become radicalised by jihadist propaganda online. In the UK, the vast majority of counter-terrorism work undertaken by the Security Service, MI5, is still directed towards plots inspired by IS or al-Qaeda. Europe is still in their sights - and the March 2024 attack on Moscows Crocus City Hall that killed more than 140 people shows that IS can seize an opportunity to strike an enemy when it is distracted, in this case by the war in Ukraine. ISs online media output is not as intense as it was when it had a physical caliphate, but it has still been able to recruit talented graphic designers and web designers to spread its message of hatred and incitement for revenge. One of its more recent videos featured a highly realistic AI-generated avatar of an Arabic-speaking newsreader, delivering his message but with no risk of the speakers identity ever being revealed. That risk of identity has dogged ISs leadership ever since the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in 2019. Without a constant, charismatic online presence  such as that enjoyed previously by the late al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden  the leadership risks looking irrelevant, remote and disconnected from its followers. However, balanced against this is the short lifespan of jihadist leaders. Once they go public, they risk their whereabouts being discovered, either by electronic surveillance and intercepts or by human informants within their own ranks. Almost nothing is known about the current leader of IS. It is exactly 10 years since the self-styled Islamic State (IS) group proclaimed its caliphate, announced to the world days later by its founder Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi from the Nuri Mosque in Mosul. Also known as Isis or Daesh in Arabic, the group took over huge swathes of Syria and Iraq, imposing its severe version of Shariah (Islamic law), meting out cruel punishments and murders, then posting the videos online. For the next five years, IS was able to attract thousands of would-be jihadists from all over the world to what it promised was a utopian Islamic caliphate. The reality was a life dominated by extreme violence: severed heads stuck on town square railings, constant harassment by patrolling ""morality police"" and frequent bombing raids by a US-led Coalition. That Coalition, numbering more than 70 nations, eventually drove out IS from its last refuge at Baghuz in eastern Syria in 2019. The physical caliphate was no more, but the ideology remained. So what has become of IS today? A senior Whitehall official in London describes the status of the group as ""down but not out"". Its dwindling core leadership remains in Syria, but IS has expanded its franchise across several continents. The bulk of attacks carried out in its name are now in sub-Saharan Africa. In Europe and the Middle East, its most dangerous branch is considered to be IS-Khorasan Province, widely blamed for this years mass casualty attacks in Moscow and Kerman in Iran. IS-Khorasan Province, or ISKP, is based in Afghanistan and north-west Pakistan, from where it is waging an insurgency against Afghanistans ruling Taliban. nan That may sound odd, given that the Taliban have imposed their own, extreme version of Shariah, banning women from jobs or even a proper education, as well as reintroducing punishments such as stoning to death. Yet the Taliban and IS are bitter rivals - and after 20 years as insurgents, the Taliban are now finding themselves the poachers turned gamekeepers. When IS had a physical base - its caliphate in Syria and Iraq - it was able to attract recruits who found it easy to fly to Turkey, catch a bus to the border and then get smuggled across into Syria. These recruits mostly lacked both military experience or any real understanding of the civil war that was tearing Syria apart. Many had a background of petty crime and drug-taking back home. These included four men from West London, nicknamed The Beatles by their captives, who ended up guarding and torturing Western aid workers and journalists. Today one is dead and the others are in prison, including two now serving life sentences in a US supermax jail. But IS is still inciting attacks via its online media. Its two principal causes right now are calls for revenge for Israels nine-month long assault on Gaza and the  imprisonment of IS women and children in grim, flyblown camps in northern Syria. Like al-Qaeda, which has also not gone away, IS thrives on disorder, despair and poor governance by whoever is in charge. In parts of Africa, there are large pockets of all three. In recent years, the countries of the Sahel belt  notably Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso  have all experienced military coups, leading to increased instability. French, American and EU troops that were helping local governments to keep the jihadist threat at bay, not always successfully, have largely been kicked out or replaced by Russian mercenaries.

IT expert 'pressurised' by Post Office over evidence,"Mrs Misra was one of hundreds of sub-postmasters and postmistresses prosecuted by the Post Office between 1999 and 2015 on the strength of faulty data from the Horizon accounting system. The technology made it look as though money was missing from Post Office branch accounts when it wasn't. At Mrs Misra's trial in 2010 she was accused of theft and false accounting. The sub-postmistress from West Byfleet, Surrey, was found guilty and sent to prison when she was eight weeks pregnant. Her conviction was quashed in 2021. Mr Jenkins said he felt, prior to the prosecution, that he was being pressurised by the Post Office to make out that Horizon was ""perfect"" in commenting on a report written by an expert witness for the defence. He added that the management of Mrs Misra's case was ""fairly chaotic"", and that requests from the Post Office legal department had been unclear. Nevertheless, in an email discussing Mrs Misra's case in 2010, he wrote that Mrs Misra ""saw an article in [tech publication] Computer Weekly indicating that Horizon was unreliable and decided to jump on the bandwagon"". Mr Jenkins said this was ""totally inappropriate wording"" and apologised. Lead counsel for the inquiry Jason Beer asked Mr Jenkins whether he had been able to give evidence dispassionately, or had he been ""afflicted"" with the belief that sub-postmasters were jumping on the bandwagon in blaming Horizon for shortfalls. Mr Jenkins said that he didn't think Horizon was the problem, and that there were ""other reasons"" for shortfalls. Responding to Mr Jenkins' evidence, Mrs Misra said she felt that the former Fujitsu engineer's comments showed the culture in the Post Office at the time, which was that sub-postmasters were to blame for shortfalls, rather than Horizon being at fault. The inquiry was also shown an email sent on 27 January 2010 where Mr Jenkins had read a report on a separate prosecution and wrote that Horizon data probably needs some further investigation. However, he said the decision to do so would be highly political. ""We don't really want to be seen to be undermining a Post Office prosecution!"" he wrote. Mr Jenkins said he wanted guidance from senior management on ""what exactly we should be doing"". Mr Beer asked: ""Why did you need guidance on whether or not Fujitsu should just present the facts irrespective of whether they supported or undermined a Post Office prosecution?"" Mr Jenkins replied: ""The guidance I got was to just tell the truth, which is what I would have liked to have done anyway."" ""Did you need guidance from management on whether you should tell the truth or not?"" Mr Beer asked. Mr Jenkins said he would just tell the truth, but said he needed guidance from management on whether he was covered by management in this. Mr Beer asked: ""You needed top cover for telling the truth?"" Mr Jenkins responded: ""I don't know what to say to that."" Mr Jenkins is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police for suspected perjury - lying to court. Mr Jenkins had knowledge of a serious bug in Horizon Online, which was a version of the software being developed at the time of the Seema Misra case. However, he didn't disclose this at her trial because she had been using a legacy version of Horizon, and so the bug was ""totally irrelevant"", he told the inquiry. Mr Beer also asked Mr Jenkins about a separate email from 2010, where he described a case as another example of postmasters trying to get away with 'Horizon has taken my money'."" Mr Jenkins was asked if that revealed his mindset when he was preparing for Mrs Misra's case. ""I can't remember what I believed, he replied, and when pressed by Mr Beer, said: ""I didn't believe there were any problems with Horizon that was causing Horizon to lose money. ""I just wasnt thinking things through properly, Mr Jenkins said, adding that he felt the Post Office wasn't training postmasters properly on the system. A Fujitsu software expert who helped build the Horizon system has said he felt pressurised by the Post Office over evidence he gave in the 2010 prosecution of sub-postmistress Seema Misra. Gareth Jenkins said the Post Office ""clearly"" wanted him to say that ""everything was perfect, and I don't think I actually said that"". However, in an email discussing the case at the time, he said Mrs Misra had ""jumped on the bandwagon"" in blaming Horizon for shortfalls in accounts. Mrs Misra told the BBC that this was an example of a culture that went ""right through the Post Office... [that] Horizon is perfect"".

Illegal driver crashed while fleeing from police,"Prosecutor Gabrielle Wilks said two officers in a marked car saw a Land Rover which ""appeared to be traveling at excessive speed"" on Toward Road on 8 August. She said the police driver had to slam his brakes on to avoid being hit by Gardiner as the Land Rover made no attempt to stop or slow down at a give way line. The police car activated its blue lights but the Land Rover drove off, with officers catching up after it crashed on Ryhope Road, Ms Wilks said. Gardiner, of Corporation Road in Sunderland, was arrested at the scene and told officers he was sorry, but had ""just panicked and took off"" as he thought he was going to be pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt, the court heard. He also admitted driving without a licence or insurance and was banned from driving for three years. Follow BBC Sunderland on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

"Impact of pylons plan is devastating, say farmers","A spokesperson for National Grid said landowners were protected by the compensation code - also used in the building of HS2 - ""to ensure fairness and consistency across the country"". ""We work closely with farmers and landowners across all our projects to reduce the impact of construction,"" they said. Mr and Mrs March have been running Vinesse Farm since 1989, although the land has been passed down through family generations for more than 100 years. According to the proposals, the farm would see 1km (0.6 miles) of underground cabling installed ""right through the middle of our farm"", as well as a single electricity pylon added. Ten acres (4ha) of their land will ""not be as productive"" after the installation, he said, after speaking to other farmers who have seen underground cables laid. Mr March also estimated that their farm would lose about 500m of hedgerows - and 30% of the affected farmland was only planted by the couple in the last 30 years. ""The land will never be able to grow what it is capable of,"" he said. ""We are devastated."" Georgina Langton McColl manages Wenham Grange farm in Suffolk with her father Richard. The land has been in her family since 1952. The proposals would mean the addition of eight pylons over 850 acres (344ha) of land, which she described as ""heart-breaking"". ""The seven fields that are going to be affected are going to be devalued, the average market rate for a acre of land is about £10,000, but I would be amazed if we would be able to sell it for £5,000,"" Ms Langton McColl said. ""The main farmhouse is going to be less than 400m from the pylon line. ""My father and I are having to have conversations like 'will this business be viable' - and we're not a small farm. ""I can only imagine what is happening to farmers who are smaller than us."" Ms Langton McColl also said the thought of the farm not being in her family for her future children is ""desperately sad"". Earlier this month, National Grid said it had run three public consultations which had more than 7,000 attendees across 40 in-person events and 17 webinars. ""The Norwich to Tilbury project is needed urgently to connect new green energy to the grid to ensure homes and businesses in East Anglia and across the country can benefit from more affordable, cleaner electricity,"" the spokesperson said. ""Proposals put forward to planning authorities always consider biodiversity and impact on the landscape."" A public consultation was expected to conclude on 18 June but has been extended until 26 July to allow for the general election. Ramsey Tyrrells Farm in Chelmsford, Essex, is 190 acres and Charlotte Blaber said the land has been in her family for 73 years. She said it was once farmed by her grandparents in the 1950s but now her mum and uncles look after it. According to proposed plans, one pylon could be put on the farm. Mrs Blaber said her family has been left distressed and devastated by the impact the plans could have on her home. She added that over the last few years, badgers, water voles, dormouse, hedgehogs and shrews have been found living within the area where the work is being proposed. ""It would be in violation of the habitats of these animals to allow any pylon to be placed onto our land."" She said National Grid has offered the family £6,000 in compensation. She said: ""Your farm is your pension and your livelihood. ""It is everything we work for."" Follow Essex news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

Incinerator plans rejected a month after approval,"The manifesto stated: ""We will prevent waste incinerators being built including those with recent permit approvals."" Mrs Bucknor said she did not think the site of the £300m waste-to-energy incinerator on the Algores Way industrial estate was appropriate. ""I was really stunned with the Conservative manifesto where it actually said they would not support any current or future incineration because only last month they approved 10, including the Wisbech one,"" she said. ""So I don't believe a word of this manifesto. We desperately need to know what Labour's policy on incinerators is."" In manifestos, launched this week, none of the other parties referred to waste incineration. Both Labour and the Greens talked about reducing waste by moving to a circular economy which involved increasing recycling. In the past, the Greens described incineration as a last resort option while the Liberal Democrats recently accused the government of inflicting the incinerator on the people of Wisbech by stealth and called for a public consultation on whether we need more incinerators. nan Charlotte Rule, head of climate and energy policy at the Environmental Services Association, a trade body for recycling and waste treatment service providers, said: ""What we do know is that for many decades to come energy from waste will play an important role in the UK's infrastructure. ""As long as waste that cannot be recycled continues to be produced, we will need energy from waste in the UK."" When the permits were issued, the Environment Agency said it would only issue a permit if it believed harm to the environment, people and wildlife would be minimised and that the operator had the ability to meet its conditions.

Incomes have risen 'at a crawl' says think tank,"The think tank's analysis found poorer households had seen the strongest growth in their disposable incomes over the period, in part thanks to the UK's strong jobs market. Looking at the poorest fifth of households, it said the one-off cost-of-living payments last year also contributed to bigger income gains. But these gains were largely offset by the impact of what the report called ""regressive tax and benefits policy decisions"", resulting in a 13% total overall rise in disposable incomes over the period. The richest households meanwhile saw only 2% income growth over the 14 year period, it said. The think tank said data from Eurostat, covering a similar but not identical period between 2007 and 2022, suggested the UK had fared worse when it came to disposable income growth than several other leading European countries, including Netherlands, France and Germany. ""While global economic shocks have been a major factor, Britains recent record is poor compared to both its own history and many of our European neighbours,"" said Lalitha Try, an economist at the Resolution Foundation. What little income growth Britain has experienced over the past 14 years has been driven primarily by rising employment, which has benefited poorer households the most,"" she said. The report entitled Hard Times was funded by the Nuffield Foundation, a charitable trust, and used data from the Department of Work and Pensions combined with jobs, pay and housing cost information. It found absolute poverty had fallen 3.6 percentage points since 2010, but in the 13 years prior to 2010 it had fallen by 14 percentage points. Relative poverty levels remained broadly stable over the last 14 years, but the number of children in large families living in poverty had risen, while those in small families living in poverty had fallen, it said. The BBC has approached all the major political parties for comment. A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: ""People are struggling with higher mortgages, higher food prices and higher taxes thanks to this governments inexcusable mismanagement."" The Scottish National Party's candidate for Glasgow North, Alison Thewliss, said the report showed the ""the devastating impact 14 years of Tory rule has had on the lives of people in Scotland"". Green Party Co-leader Carla Denyer said the report showed ""why we need a new generation of Green MPs elected to push a timid Labour government to be bolder and braver in tackling the cost-of-living crisis"".

Green Party Co-leader Carla Denyer said the report showed ""why we need a new generation of Green MPs elected to push a timid Labour government to be bolder and braver in tackling the cost-of-living crisis"". Slow economic growth and three major economic shocks have meant households' disposable incomes have grown very slowly since 2010, according to a think tank report. Typical household incomes went up by just £140 a year, new analysis from the Resolution Foundation showed. That is a total rise over the 14 year period of just 7% - or an average of half a percent a year - in the amount people had left over to spend after paying tax. By contrast, disposable incomes rose 38% over the 14 years up to 2010, the poverty-focused think tank wrote. However, poorer households had seen stronger income growth than richer ones, it said. The Resolution Foundation said the 2008 financial crisis, the Covid pandemic and high inflation had all contributed to the slowdown, but that growth in general had also been ""sluggish"". That resulted in income rises ""slowing to a crawl"" it said, hampering progress in reducing poverty levels. The state of the economy, and especially the squeeze on ordinary families through the cost of living crisis, is a central theme in the general election, with the Conservatives defending their record in government since 2010. The think tank's analysis found poorer households had seen the strongest growth in their disposable incomes over the period, in part thanks to the UK's strong jobs market. Looking at the poorest fifth of households, it said the one-off cost-of-living payments last year also contributed to bigger income gains. But these gains were largely offset by the impact of what the report called ""regressive tax and benefits policy decisions"", resulting in a 13% total overall rise in disposable incomes over the period. The richest households meanwhile saw only 2% income growth over the 14 year period, it said. The think tank said data from Eurostat, covering a similar but not identical period between 2007 and 2022, suggested the UK had fared worse when it came to disposable income growth than several other leading European countries, including Netherlands, France and Germany. ""While global economic shocks have been a major factor, Britains recent record is poor compared to both its own history and many of our European neighbours,"" said Lalitha Try, an economist at the Resolution Foundation. What little income growth Britain has experienced over the past 14 years has been driven primarily by rising employment, which has benefited poorer households the most,"" she said. The report entitled Hard Times was funded by the Nuffield Foundation, a charitable trust, and used data from the Department of Work and Pensions combined with jobs, pay and housing cost information. It found absolute poverty had fallen 3.6 percentage points since 2010, but in the 13 years prior to 2010 it had fallen by 14 percentage points. Relative poverty levels remained broadly stable over the last 14 years, but the number of children in large families living in poverty had risen, while those in small families living in poverty had fallen, it said. The BBC has approached all the major political parties for comment. A Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: ""People are struggling with higher mortgages, higher food prices and higher taxes thanks to this governments inexcusable mismanagement."" The Scottish National Party's candidate for Glasgow North, Alison Thewliss, said the report showed the ""the devastating impact 14 years of Tory rule has had on the lives of people in Scotland"". Green Party Co-leader Carla Denyer said the report showed ""why we need a new generation of Green MPs elected to push a timid Labour government to be bolder and braver in tackling the cost-of-living crisis""."
Increase in child deaths recorded,"During the year under review, Sandwell recorded 40 child deaths and Dudley 35, compared with 27 the previous year. Walsall recorded 29 in the same period, a rise of 11 from the previous year. And Wolverhampton had 24 child deaths - 13 more than the previous year. Of the 128 child death notifications, 57 were aged zero to 27 days, 22 were aged 28-364 days, 16 were in the one to four age range, 16 were aged five to nine years and 17 notified child deaths were in children aged 10 years and over. The panel looks to identify ""modifiable factors"" which have caused deaths and shares findings to learn lessons for preventing them in the future. Smoking, alcohol and substance misuse and maternal obesity were identified as common factors in perinatal and neonatal deaths. The report said unsafe sleeping arrangements were also a major factor in sudden or unexpected child deaths.

"Inquests lack 'humanity', says bereaved father","Mr Fryatt said: When families like ours are sucked into a coroners inquest, it happens when chaos is in your brain and turmoil is in your heart."" His comments form part of a three-year research project, called Voicing Loss, published by Birkbeck, University of London and the University of Bath. The universities interviewed 89 grieving relatives and found most had hoped for truth and justice from the inquest process, as well as and also for lessons to be learnt to prevent future deaths. Mr Fryatt said his sons inquest ""didnt deliver that"". ""Weve seen this from so many other grieving families, with similar stories. It is a systemic failing,"" he said. Coroners can alert relevant bodies  such as the government, hospitals, schools and companies  by writing Prevention of Future Deaths reports. Mr Fryatt said: ""The prevention of future deaths notice sent to public bodies and health authorities to guard against repeated failings might as well be thrown in the bin. ""Theyre a false promise and a missed opportunity."" In 2023 almost 200,000 deaths were reported to coroners, and almost 40,000 inquests were concluded. The research has called for changes to the inquest process with better ""kind and compassionate"" communication between the coroner and the bereaved people. The study found that the coroner service is under-resourced and over-stretched, and there have been calls for the creation of a unified national service to replace the current local authority-based system. The Ministry of Justice said it has delivered a number of measures to make inquests more sympathetic to bereaved families. It added that because coroners are independent judicial office holders it would be inappropriate to comment on how they manage investigations, inquests and caseloads.

There would be no strobe lighting, and the venue was wheelchair accessible. Mx Middlefinch said: ""We want to be an alternative to the public face of official Pride - as much as we love drag and cis performers - we want a space for people who are not on the forefront."" Eat Up hosts workshops year-round for queer performers who wanted to find a way into the Bristol music scene. The collective then offered them their first gigs, to ""level the playing field"", Mx Middlefinch said. ""The feedback we get is that people wish more things like this existed,"" they added. ""We try to keep the spirit of the DIY culture alive. ""We're still proud queer people - but maybe quietly proud. We're quite nerdy."" One of the bands playing at the event is Freakshow, an all queer group of friends who decided to make music together. ""This event represents everything we stand for: queer inclusivity,"" Tash Payton, on keys, said. ""It means a lot to us as a non-male queer band to be seen, individually to us personally not just as a band. ""We've seen inclusive spaces like this grow recently, but there could always be more.""

""I geared this event towards people who feel they don't fit in with more traditional ceilidh events. ""I want the event to represent the folk scene in Bristol, and take it outside its context.""

"Inverness e-bikes suspended after £50,000 vandalism bill","Bikes have been found crashed and broken, while others have been thrown into rivers and the Caledonian Canal. In Inverness, bikes have been damaged by people attempting to wrenching them out of charging stations. Hi-Bike was set up in 2021 by regional public transport body Hitrans and it has 112 bikes. Rentals are available for 30 minutes to three hours, and people can also sign up for monthly or an annual memberships. Prices for using the bikes range from £2.50 to £80, and they can be rented via an app. Hitrans said the scheme had been popular with local residents and visitors. There have been almost 40,000 ""rides"" since its launch three years ago, and there are plans to expand it to other locations, including Inverness' Raigmore Hospital. Last week, Hi-Bike was highly commended in the transport team of the year category at the Scottish Transport Awards. Hitrans said there had been a ""huge surge"" in vandalism since the Easter school holidays. It said there had also been incidents involving young people sitting in the front baskets of bikes while being pedalled through Inverness city centre, sometimes against the flow of traffic. Ranald Robertson, partnership director at Hitrans, said: ""It is disappointing that a small minority of people are misusing the system. ""Those who choose to ride the bikes with others sitting in the basket will have their membership suspended should this be reported, while any and all incidents of vandalism are being reported to Police Scotland and the British Transport Police. A British Transport Police spokesperson said: Officers are investigating reports of damage to bikes at Inverness railway station. ""Inquiries are ongoing and anyone with information can contact British Transport Police."" A public electric bike service has been suspended in Inverness service after ""relentless vandalism"" left just six of its 56 bikes in the city available for use. Hi-Bike's Fort William bikes have also been targeted.  The cost of recent vandalism to the scheme, which was set up three years ago, runs to £50,000. In the past few days across Inverness and Fort William, eight of Hi-Bike's £4,000 bikes have been stolen and about 20 damaged. British Transport Police said it was investigating damage to bikes at a hub at Inverness Railway Station.

Iran warns Israel of âobliterating warâ if it attacks Lebanon,"Iran has warned Israel against âfull-scale military aggressionâ in Lebanon and said it would lead to an âobliterating warâ, the Islamic republicâs United Nations mission said. âAll options, [including] the full involvement of all Resistance Fronts, are on the table,â the mission wrote in a post on X late on Friday, referring to Iran-aligned armed groups across the region. It called Israelâs threats to attack Hezbollah in Lebanon âpsychological warfareâ and âpropagandaâ. The border between the two countries has witnessed daily exchanges of fire between Israeli forces and Hezbollah since the current conflict in Gaza broke out on October 7. Fears of a full-blown war grew this month after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel was preparing for âa very tense operationâ on the border with Lebanon. Israeli forces conducted a series of attacks on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon, an Israeli army spokesperson said early on Saturday. âIn the past few hours, warplanes attacked several Hezbollah targets, including a military site for the organisation in the Zabqin area, two operational infrastructure sites in the Khiam area, and a Hezbollah building in the al-Adissa [Odaisseh] area,â according to the Israeli Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper. nan nan Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said his country does not want to fight a war against Hezbollah, but that the army is ready for it. âWe are working on a political solution. That is always the better option,â Gallant said during a visit on Friday to troops near Israelâs northern border with Lebanon. Gallant said this week in the United States that Israel was âpreparing for every scenarioâ. âHezbollah understands very well that we can inflict massive damage in Lebanon if a war is launched,â he said in Washington, DC. Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah has threatened a war with âno restraint and no rules and no ceilingsâ in case of a major Israeli offensive against Lebanon. Amid the growing tensions, several countries, including Germany, Canada, the Netherlands and the United States, have urged their nationals to leave or avoid travel to Lebanon. nan"
Is sugar the missing ingredient in election manifestos?,"But like unwanted leftovers on a plate, those plans were cast aside by his successors at 10 Downing Street. Theresa May and Boris Johnson were unimpressed by the menu of anti-obesity policies and sceptical about the state intervening in public health. The government, it was argued, should not interfere in people's decisions about what to eat and drink. The pandemic complicated these debates as ministers and officials focused solely on tackling Covid-19. And when soaring food price inflation took a toll on households, politicians argued that adding a tax on sugary foods would not be fair. The result of all this? Restrictions on where unhealthy products can be promoted in supermarkets have been introduced in England. But other policies discussed on and off for a decade have been postponed until October 2025.  The ban on advertising these items on broadcast outlets before 21:00 and at any time online will not start until then. There will also be a ban on ""buy one get one free"" promotions. The delay was announced in June 2023 by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, who explained his thinking: ""At a time when household budgets are under continuing pressure from the global rise in food prices it is not fair for government to restrict the options available to consumers on their weekly shop."" In England the proportion of adults classified as overweight or obese increased from 61.2% in 2015-16, to 63.8% in 2021-22, according to government data. Opponents of the sugar tax on drinks may point to those figures to argue that it didn't have enough impact. Supporters will say the numbers would have been worse if the levy had not been imposed. A study last year published in PLOS Medicine concluded that it was ""associated with decreased prevalence of obesity in year six girls, with the greatest differences in those living in the most deprived areas"". Internationally, the statistics make for depressing reading. A report in The Lancet in February stated that, based on 2022 data, more than one billion people globally were living with obesity. The UK, with 27% of men reported to be obese, fared worse than Germany (23%), Spain (19%), Italy (18%), and France (10%). The financial pressures are obvious. The costs associated with diabetes care are rising fast. University of York research concludes that diabetes cost the UK nearly £14bn in 2021-22  with more than £10bn for the NHS. Demand for weight-loss drugs for diabetics such as Wegovy is expected to rise sharply. Doctors say the risk of type 2 diabetes can be lowered by healthy diet and exercise. The stats are clear, but what is the reality for patients? Professor Kamila Hawthorne is president of the Royal College of GPs. A few years ago she moved to a practice in a deprived area of South Wales where she sees many overweight and obese patients. They are more likely to develop back and knee pain and so need time off work, she says. They are also at higher risk of developing diabetes, cancer or high blood pressure. GPs can encourage people to move to healthier diets, Prof Hawthorne adds, but there is only so much they can do. With many of her patients holding down several jobs while raising kids ""they just dont have time and so go for takeaways"", she says. ""They know what the problem is and they have tried to lose weight but they often feel helpless"". Dr Jack Jacobs, a GP who practices near Ashford in Kent, says diabetic and pre-diabetic numbers have increased by about 50% over five years and mainly in younger adults. He says local GP surgeries have employed a health coach to promote activity such as Couch to 5k but ""there seems to be a lack of effort on education around diet and lifestyle - its astonishing that some teenagers and young adults just dont seem to understand what exercise is"". The British Medical Journal has reported that one in six integrated care boards, responsible for managing health services in their region, have stopped taking on patients for specialist weight management services. Patient numbers were said to have spiralled out of control with demand far exceeding capacity. An academic expert told the BMJ that where services do exist they are often over-subscribed and at risk of budget cuts. Some other experts are saying that only a cross-government approach will be adequate to tackle the problems. Professor Jonathan Pearson-Stuttard, Head of health analytics at the consultancy firm LCP, says it must be a priority for all Whitehall departments: The links between ill-health and poor economic outcomes are increasingly clear. Preventing the onset of illness is key to managing the complex demand for healthcare as well as underpinning health-driven prosperity. So why have political leaders not done more? Clearly some have been concerned about accusations of a nanny state if restrictions are imposed. Business leaders also tend to push back when new taxes on food are proposed. The Food and Drink Federation says these taxes will not drive reformulation. This is industry-speak for creating new recipes with fewer unhealthy ingredients while attempting not to lose customers. In a statement a spokesperson said: The food and drink industry knows it has an important role to play in tackling obesity and poor diets and we would welcome the opportunity to work with government and others to find solutions to better support balanced diets and healthier lifestyles. The industry also continues to invest in the innovation necessary to alter the recipes of much-loved products to make them healthier, by removing fat, salt and sugar, and adding additional fruit, vegetables and fibre, giving consumers a broader choice of healthier food and drink. Governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have developed their own obesity strategies. All four UK nations have tended to defend existing policies and point to bold ambitions for intervention. But as the debate around the sustainability of the NHS intensifies, a broader discussion about health will be required - and that has not been forthcoming in this campaign. The snag is that devising joined-up policies across different departments will take time and does not make for snappy manifesto headlines.

There was a lot to chew on in the party manifestos on health and the NHS, with promises to cut waiting lists, modernise hospitals and create more GP and dentist appointments. But plans around prevention were in short supply on these political menus - as were proposals about how to help us stay healthier. With a developing obesity and diabetes crisis, as well as increasing numbers of children needing emergency treatment because of rotting teeth, some experts say keeping people out of hospital is just as important as caring for them once they get ill. A recent report from the Health Foundation think tank concluded that ""the nations health is fraying, placing a growing burden on public services and limiting future prosperity. Much of this ill-health could be prevented."" Tackling sugar consumption would be a vital part of any drive to improve the populations health, but the word ""sugar"" only appears twice in total in the manifestos of the five main parties in England. That's surprising given that policies to curb sugar consumption and regulate unhealthy food products have been debated very publicly for nearly a decade. In 2015, chef Jamie Oliver started his own campaign for a sugar tax, after filming a six-year-old-boy having rotten teeth pulled out under general anaesthetic for a TV documentary. The government did introduce a tax on high-sugar soft drinks in 2018. Manufacturers anxious to avoid paying it cut sugar levels in their products so that they fell below the levy threshold. The Institute for Government reported that total sugar sold in soft drinks fell by more than 35% between 2015 and 2019. Attention then turned to sugary foods. Public Health England (which has since been abolished) started publishing league tables of the sugar content of items like biscuits, cakes and cereals. There was a veiled threat by officials and some ministers of a levy. In his final weeks in office in 2016, then-Prime Minister David Cameron was close to unveiling plans to ban ""buy one get one free"" deals for unhealthy products in supermarkets and restrict TV ads for junk food and other high-sugar products. But like unwanted leftovers on a plate, those plans were cast aside by his successors at 10 Downing Street. Theresa May and Boris Johnson were unimpressed by the menu of anti-obesity policies and sceptical about the state intervening in public health.

Island railway line faces further closures,"The line has already undergone closures that lasted for several months over the past few years.

Hereâs what happened today: âWhen very little amount of aid comes through, of course there is going to be a huge rush from the population to go and get it,â said UNWRA spokesperson Louise Wateridge, adding that people in Gaza are âdesperateâ. âThe only answer to that is to provide more aid,â she said in a video on X. nan Hezbollah is preparing for different scenarios as the low-level conflict between Israel threatens to spin out into something larger. Justin Salhani, reporting from Beirut, takes a look at what could happen, here. Speaking at a weekly news briefing, Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, the spokesperson of Pakistanâs Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said Pakistan decries the indiscriminate Israeli bombing of civiliansâ houses in Beit Lahiya in the northern part of the Strip, resulting in several casualties. Baloch said her country calls for an immediate ceasefire to end the atrocities. Osama Hamdan, a senior Hamas official based in Lebanon, says the Palestinian group is still ready to discuss any truce proposal that ends the nearly nine-month conflict. âOnce again, Hamas is ready to deal positively with any proposal that secures a permanent ceasefire, a comprehensive withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and a serious swap deal,â Hamdan told a news conference in Beirut. Arab mediatorsâ efforts, backed by the United States, have so far failed to conclude a ceasefire, with both sides blaming each other for the impasse. Hamas says any deal must end the war for good and bring full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. Israel says it will accept only temporary pauses in fighting until Hamas, which has governed Gaza since 2007, is âeradicatedâ. Hamdan said the group had yet to receive a new ceasefire proposal from mediators. Meanwhile, an estimated 130,000 Israelis converged in Tel Aviv on Saturday night demanding an immediate truce deal to bring the captives home. Read the full report here. A family member of a captive who was held by Hamas in Gaza says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahuâs insistence on not stopping the war as part of the prisoner exchange deal is âwhat stands between us and our loved onesâ. âContinuing the war means that the captives will be killed by the government of Israel. The blood is on your hands,â Ella Metzger, the daughter-in-law of Yoram Metzger, who died in Hamas captivity aged 80, said at an antigovernment protest in Tel Aviv on Saturday. âTime and time again, Netanyahu derails all deals at the last minute. Netanyahu must be prevented from blocking the deal next time.â According to a UN-backed report, half a million people in Gaza are experiencing âcatastrophicâ hunger. The report highlighted a âhigh and sustained risk of famineâ in the besieged territory. Al Jazeeraâs Hind Khoudary reports. nan Palestinians in Lebanon have watched Israelâs assault on Gaza with simmering anger and are now facing the prospect of a similar fate if Israel wages an all-out war against the Lebanese group Hezbollah.

Here is a recap of todayâs events: Here are a few highlights from the content recently published on Israelâs war against Gaza: And thereâs plenty more here. The Palestinian Civil Defence Agency has reported that three of its medics were killed in an overnight Israeli air strike near its headquarters in Nuseirat, central Gaza Strip. Al Jazeeraâs Michael Appel reports: nan The Israeli army says it detected three explosive-laden drones and rockets fired from Lebanon towards northern Israel but that it launched interceptor missiles that downed the projectiles. It added that 25 rockets were fired towards the Western Galilee area and at the Kiryat Shmona settlement, noting that most were intercepted. At least some of the rockets, however, caused damage to a building in the Western Galilee area and started several fires in northern Israel. They triggered the activation of sirens in different areas in northern Israel. No injuries were reported from the attacks, said the army. After some countries issued warnings to their nationals to leave or avoid travel to Lebanon amid tension with Israel, Lebanese Foreign Minister Abdullah Bou Habib urged them to stop causing âconcern among citizens and visitors [to Lebanon]â and instead show solidarity. Amid growing tension between Israel and Lebanon, several countries, including Germany, Canada, North Macedonia, Netherlands, the US and others have urged their nationals to leave or avoid travel to Lebanon. In recent weeks, tensions have escalated between the Israeli army and the Lebanese armed group, Hezbollah, raising concerns about a potential full-scale war following Tel Avivâs recent approval of operational plans for a âwide-scale attackâ against Lebanon. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) says it received two aid trucks loaded with flour. In coordination with the UN refugee agency, the aid was distributed among some 1,240 displaced families in Gaza and in northern Gaza, the group said in a post on X. nan Hereâs a recap of the latest developments: nan The Biden administration has sent to Israel massive shipments of munitions, including more than 10,000 highly destructive 2,000-pound bombs and thousands of Hellfire missiles, since the start of the war in Gaza, said two US officials, Reuters news agency reported. The US has transferred at least 14,000 of the MK-84 2,000-pound bombs, 6,500 500-pound bombs, 3,000 Hellfire precision-guided air-to-ground missiles, 1,000 bunker-buster bombs, 2,600 air-dropped small-diameter bombs, and other munitions, according to the officials. The tally of shipments suggests there has been no significant drop-off in US military support for Israel. âWhile these numbers could be expended relatively quickly in a major conflict, this list clearly reflects a substantial level of support from the United States for our Israeli allies,â Tom Karako, a weapons expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Reuters. Earlier this week, a senior Biden administration official said that the US sent $6.5bn worth of weapons to Israel since the war began. nan"
Israeli forces arrest 28 Palestinians in raids in occupied West Bank,"The Israeli military has arrested 28 Palestinians in a series of raids across the occupied West Bank, according to a Palestinian rights group. The overnight raids, part of Israelâs increasingly violent assault on the occupied territories, targeted the governorates of Jenin, Hebron, Bethlehem, Ramallah and el-Bireh, Nablus and Jerusalem, said the Palestinian Prisonerâs Society on Thursday. Israeli forces had doled out âsevere beatingsâ and made threats against detaineesâ families, said the group, which keeps a daily tally of arrests. Violence in the West Bank, already on the rise before Israelâs current war on Gaza erupted in October, has since escalated with frequent army raids on Palestinian groups, rampages by Jewish settlers in Palestinian villages, and deadly Palestinian street attacks. Reporting from Ramallah, Al Jazeeraâs Nour Odeh said the Israeli military had âdramaticallyâ increased its operations, conducting about 38 raids a day, with an uptick in detentions. Home demolitions have gone up by 25 percent since last year, displacing more than 1,000 Palestinians. In Jenin, where nine Palestinians were arrested, armed confrontations broke out in the city and its refugee camp in the early hours of Thursday. Palestinian media said Israeli forces had raided a pharmacy near Jenin Government Hospital, on the outskirts of Jenin refugee camp, transferring detainees to an unknown destination. A resident said Israeli bulldozers destroyed infrastructure inside the camp and in the city of Jenin. During the raid, Palestinian fighters attacked Israeli armoured vehicles with explosive devices, killing one soldier and wounding 16. âThere were two explosions. The first one caused injuries. The second, thatâs where the death happened,â said Odeh. âAccording to preliminary Israeli investigations, the devices were buried or located a metre and a half into the ground, so deeper than the Israeli military vehicles usually dig to be able to find those improvised devices,â she said. The Israeli military confirmed the death. The soldier âfell during operational activity in the area of Jeninâ, it said in a statement. nan nan Meanwhile, the Wafa news agency reported that four Palestinians were arrested in an overnight swoop on Hebron. Israeli forces had stormed the town of Yatta, south of the city of Hebron, arresting three people, including a female university student. Another man was arrested in the town of Dura, southwest of Hebron. The Israeli military also arrested a man after shooting him in the foot in the Qalandiya refugee camp, while another man was taken into custody in Deir Ghassana village, northwest of Ramallah. Since October 7, Israel has carried out a total of 9,430 arrests in the West Bank in near daily raids. The United Nationsâ human rights chief Volker Turk warned this month that the situation in the West Bank was âdramatically deterioratingâ, saying earlier that people there were being âsubjected to day after day of unprecedented bloodshedâ."
Israeli forces intensify attacks in Shujayea as Gaza death toll rises,"The Israeli military has said its troops are intensifying operations in the Shujayea neighbourhood east of Gaza City and âfighting simultaneously above and below groundâ. In a situational update on Saturday, it claimed troops had eliminated âa large number of terroristsâ over the past day and located a weapons storage facility within a school compound. It said the air force also struck âterror targets and armed terrorist cells, including a terrorist cell that was on its way to fire at troopsâ. The Israeli military earlier issued a statement requiring residents in Shujayea and adjacent areas to move southwards along the arterial Salah al-Din Street, which crosses the length of the enclave. Reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, Al Jazeeraâs Hind Khoudary said Israeli forces targeted a group of Palestinians in Gaza City trying to fill water containers at a distribution point. âFour Palestinians from the same family, the al-Ghazi family, were killed in this shelling. Among them was a child,â she said. âWe saw a video online showing the child in the arms of his father, covered with blood, lying on the ground before the paramedics were able to go and transfer them to the hospital.â nan nan United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the new Israeli offensive in Shujayea has forced the displacement of âat least 60,000â residents. âHumanitarian partners are reporting new displacement â¦ Yesterday, the Israeli military ordered people living in 28 residential blocks in areas east of Gaza City to immediately evacuate â¦ at least 60,000 people were displaced from this area, which spans over seven square kilometres [2.7 square miles]â, Dujarric said. Meanwhile, the Israeli army said its troops were continuing its intelligence-based operation in Rafah in southern Gaza and had âeliminated numerous terrorists in the areaâ over the past day. In central Gaza, the army said it âeliminated numerous terroristsâ on the ground, and the air force had struck âseveral anti-tank missile postsâ. Two projectiles were also identified crossing from Gaza into Israelâs Sderot â the Aerial Defense Array intercepted one, and the other fell into an open area. Dujarric also said that a military operation in the area of al-Mawasi in southern Gaza, designated a âsafe zoneâ by Israel, resulted in many casualties and the displacement of at least 5,000 people. At least two people were killed in an Israeli bombing near al-Istiqama Mosque in the al-Jnaina neighbourhood east of Rafah, sources told Al Jazeera. A number of others were injured when Israeli forces opened fire in the vicinity of al-Alam roundabout, west of Rafah. On Saturday, Gazaâs Ministry of Health said at least 37,834 people have been killed and 86,858 wounded in Israelâs war on Gaza since October 7. The updated death toll included 40 Palestinians killed and 224 wounded in the past 24-hour reporting period, it said. nan nan"
Israeli forces kill six Palestinians in West Bank raid,"Israeli forces have killed six Palestinians during a raid in the village of Kafr Dan near Jenin in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Ministry of Health has said, as Israel intensifies its attacks on the territory amid the war on Gaza. An Israeli special forces unit entered the village on Tuesday and besieged a home before shelling it, the official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported. The six slain men were aged 21 to 32, according to the Health Ministry. One of them, Ahmad Smoudi, was the brother of a 12-year-old child who was fatally shot by Israeli forces in Jenin in 2022. The Jenin battalion of the al-Quds Brigades â the armed wing of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad â had said earlier on Tuesday that it was engaged in âfierceâ fighting with Israeli troops in Kafr Dan. The Israeli military said it carried out a âcounterterrorismâ operation in the village, killing four armed Palestinians. The army added that it used attack helicopters in the assault and sustained no casualties. Israeli forces killed four Palestinians west of Ramallah on Monday and three others in Jenin on Friday. The Israeli military has been regularly conducting deadly raids in the West Bank over the past few years â a trend that escalated with the start of the war on Gaza. nan nan According to Palestinian health authorities, Israel has killed 544 Palestinians, including 133 children, in the West Bank since October 2023 when the violence in Gaza broke out. Israel has also detained thousands of Palestinians during that period. Palestinians in the West Bank have also faced violent attacks from Israeli settlers, who have assaulted farmers and raided Palestinian towns in the past months, often under the protection of the Israeli military. Rawhi Fattouh, Palestinian National Council, said the Israeli raids in the West Bank was a âcontinuation of the massacres, ethnic cleansing and genocide targeting the Palestinian people in Gazaâ. âThis racist [Israeli] government is looking through all means to detonate the situation in the West Bank and the region and to turn the conflict into a religious, ideological fight that would bring the region into a furnace of violence, killing and massacres,â Fattouh said in a statement. He called on the international community to intervene and âquell this madnessâ."
Israeli forces kill three Palestinians in raid on West Bankâs Jenin,"Israeli forces have killed at least three Palestinians during a raid in the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank, the Palestinian Health Ministry has said, as Israel intensifies its deadly attacks in the territory. The three have been identified as Ibrahim Taher Muhammad al-Saadi, 21; Issa Nafez Jallad, 17; and Uday Ayman Marei, 24, the Palestinian news agency Wafa cited the director of Jeninâs government hospital as saying. The director, Wissam Bakr, said 15 others were wounded and have been transferred to several hospitals including Jeninâs al-Razi and Ibn Sina Hospital. The Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said its crews dealt with eight wounded people during the raid, including five who were shot with live bullets and two who suffered shrapnel wounds. The al-Quds Brigades, the armed wing of Palestinian Islamic Jihad, said in a statement that its fighters were engaged in âviolent clashesâ near the Jenin refugee camp. Wafa cited its correspondent as saying a convoy of Israeli army vehicles, including bulldozers, entered the area backed by Apache attack helicopters. The report said Israeli army tanks belonging to special forces destroyed stands belonging to local vendors and shot bullets towards the main electrical transformer in the camp, which resulted in a power outage. Hospitals were surrounded and emergency services were prevented from reaching the injured, it added. At least two people have also been detained. The Israeli army routinely carries out raids in the city and its adjacent camp. The West Bank has experienced a surge in violence for more than a year, but especially since Israel launched its latest deadly assault on the besieged Gaza Strip on October 7. At least 530 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank by Israeli soldiers or illegal settlers since October, according to Palestinian officials. Thousands have also been arrested, many of whom are being held under administrative detention, a widely criticised practice that involves Israeli forces imprisoning Palestinians without trial or charge for renewable six-month periods. Earlier this week, United Nations rights chief Volker Turk decried the bloodshed. âPervasive impunity for such crimes has been commonplace for far too long in the occupied West Bank,â he said, adding that this has created an environment for more âunlawful killingsâ by Israeli forces. Meanwhile, Israel continues to bombard the Gaza Strip as it steps up ground incursions in the southern and middle areas of the enclave. More than 36,650 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, mostly women and children."
"Israeli military raids Jenin refugee camp, killing civilians",nan
Israeli soldier killed during West Bank raid,"There has been a surge in violence in the West Bank since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip, which was triggered by Hamas's deadly attack on southern Israel on 7 October. The UN says 536 Palestinians - members of armed groups, attackers and civilians - had been killed as of Monday in conflict-related incidents across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. At least 519 have been killed by Israeli forces and 10 by Israeli settlers, it adds. Twelve Israelis, including eight security forces personnel, had also been killed in the West Bank during the same period, according to the UN. Another eight Israelis had been killed in attacks by Palestinians from the West Bank. The Palestinian Prisoners Society said on Thursday morning that at least 28 Palestinians - including nine from Jenin governorate - had been arrested across the West Bank over the previous day, bringing the total number of arrests since October to 9,430. Jenin has seen regular Israeli raids, with the military previously saying it was targeting Hamas and PIJ operatives. On Saturday, the military said its forces had violated protocol by strapping a wounded Palestinian man to the front of their jeep during operations in Jenin. One Israeli soldier has been killed and 16 others reportedly injured during a military raid in Jenin in the north of the occupied West Bank. According to residents, Israeli forces raided a pharmacy just outside Jenins urban refugee camp overnight, arresting people inside. Armoured bulldozers damaged nearby infrastructure, they say. Israeli media report that one roadside bomb injured soldiers in an armoured vehicle as they left Jenin. As additional troops arrived to help them, another bomb exploded, killing the soldier. Reports said one of the soldiers was in a serious condition, with others moderately or lightly hurt. The armed group Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) claimed it detonated the bombs. Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that a young Palestinian man was injured in the face by bullet shrapnel during violent confrontations that took place during the raid.

Israeli strikes on Gaza may have violated laws of war - UN report,"The report published by the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) on Wednesday examined six strikes where it said Israel might have violated fundamental principles of the laws of war. The strikes allegedly involved the use of 2,000lb (907kg), 1,000lb (453kg), and 250lb (110kg) air-dropped munitions, known respectively as GBU-31, GBU-32 and GBU-39s. The UN report says GBU-31, GBU-32 and GBU-39s are mostly used to penetrate through several floors of concrete and can completely collapse tall structures. Given how densely populated the areas targeted were, the use of such a wide-area effect weapon would have in all likelihood resulted in an indiscriminate attack, it adds. Explosive weapons with such wide-area effects cannot be directed at a specific military object in densely populated areas of Gaza, and the effects cannot be limited, resulting in military objects, civilians and civilian objects being struck without distinction. The report says no specific warning was issued before five of the strikes, and that the presence of one commander, several combatants, or several military objectives in one area does not render an entire neighbourhood a military objective. The requirement to select means and methods of warfare that avoid or at the very least minimise to every extent civilian harm appears to have been consistently violated in Israels bombing campaign,"" UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk said. He called on Israel to make public the detailed findings of the IDFs investigations into the six incidents with a view to identifying those responsible for violations, holding them to account and to ensuring all victims' rights to truth, justice and reparations. Israels mission to the UN in Geneva condemned the report, saying it suffers from hindsight and methodological biases which cast a shadow on the credibility of its legal assessment. The only objective of this thematic report is to lambast and single-out Israel, while further shielding Hamas terrorists in Gaza, it added. It also asserted that the conclusions were based on public information and data published by Hamas, overlooked operational considerations, and did not address Hamass tactics. Hamas systematically and unlawfully embeds its military assets within populated areas, and carries out its military activities amongst, behind, and under its own civilians in a deliberate and strategic attempt to maximize civilian harm, it said. It also cynically manipulates the statistics surrounding casualties. It added: Israel is committed to its obligations under national and international law, and in particular, the principles of distinction, proportionality and precautions. The report published by the UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) on Wednesday examined six strikes where it said Israel might have violated fundamental principles of the laws of war.

It is the conclusion of a report on what it calls six emblematic attacks on residential buildings, a school, refugee camps and a market between 9 October and 2 December last year. The UN says it has verified that at least 218 people were killed in the incidents and that civilian objects were destroyed. Israels mission in Geneva rejected the UNs findings as ""factually, legally, and methodologically flawed. It insisted that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was operating in Gaza in accordance with international law and accused Hamas of unlawfully embedding itself among civilians. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Palestinian armed group in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 37,390 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Its figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants, but it had reportedly identified 14,680 children, women and elderly people among the dead by the end of April.

Italian brothers honoured for decades at restaurant,"Two brothers who ran one of the most successful Italian restaurants in Leeds for almost 50 years have been recognised in the King's Birthday Honours List. Geppino ""Gip"" Dammone, 68, and his brother Gianfranco ""John"", 64, have served generations of customers at Salvo's in Headingley. The pair, who have been at the restaurant from its opening in 1976 until retiring last year, have been awarded a British Empire Medal (BEM) for their services to hospitality. Gip Dammone said it was an ""absolute honour"" to be recognised in the field in he had devoted most of his life to. nan The brothers moved to Yorkshire with their parents following a cholera outbreak in their native country and went on to set up the restaurant, initially running it with their father Salvatore. Recalling the earliest memories of Salvo's, Gip Dammone said: ""Weirdly, there were more pizzerias in the north of England than there were in London. ""We were the first wave of affordable restaurants where you could go in, have some pizza or some pasta, have a litre of wine and it'd be £1.30 or something like that. ""The pizzas were 70p when we opened and they were exotic things, so we were successful straightaway."" The brothers helped introduce novel dining concepts to customers, including shared tables between different guest groups, handing out free pizza slices to those queuing and taking no bookings. Salvo's has since won numerous food awards and remained in the Good Food Guide every year since 1985. It also held a prestigious AA rosette, an award recognising culinary excellence, since 2010. ""We've got three generations of people - they came before, now they come in with their children and their children come in with their children,"" Gip Dammone said. ""In the restaurant there's been three generations of my family working too."" Outside of the restaurant, the brothers have worked closely with the local community, such as by buying meat from local farmers, which was reciprocated when people supported the restaurant during the Covid pandemic. Their work also includes events with local charities and schools, and mentoring and cooking lessons with children. Gip Dammone said he was most proud of seeing those he had taught go on to establish their own well-respected restaurants and culinary careers ""from Bangkok to Whitby"". Other people recognised in the King's Birthday Honour's List include 80-year-old Thomas Long who has been awarded a BEM for services to the community in Wakefield. Mr Long founded the Senior Citizens Support Group in 2010 and has developed activities for older people in Horbury and the surrounding district to tackle social isolation and loneliness. Supriya Nagarajan, 58, also receives a BEM for services to music for her role as founder, chief executive officer and artistic director at Manasamitra in Dewsbury. Through Manasamitra, she supports dozens of artists locally and nationally as well as mentoring community artists and school children. Her work also helps create opportunities for individuals to overcome socio-economic barriers to achieve their goals. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

Jail for North Yorkshire man who ran woman down in car,"Jack David Brown, 27, of Hunton, North Yorkshire, drove at the woman who had stepped into the road to protect three children on ponies, a court heard. He admitted careless driving, causing serious injury by dangerous driving and breaching a restraining order. At Teesside Crown Court on Wednesday, he was jailed for two years and eight months and given a 10-year driving ban. The incident took place at about 15:00 GMT on Saturday 15 January 2022 on Leyburn Road in Hunton, the court had been told The victim, a woman in her 50s, was walking at the rear of a group of children riding ponies when Brown approached noisily at speed in his new pick-up truck, police said. Fearing the animals would be spooked, the woman waved her arms to warn Brown to slow down and she stepped slightly out into the road. However, Brown then turned his vehicle towards the victim, hitting her and knocking her down, before continuing on to his home without stopping. A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said the woman had been taken to hospital where she was treated for a broken vertebra. Despite claiming the victim had ""thrown herself"" at his vehicle, police said Brown changed his plea to guilty before a trial was due to get under way. Speaking after Brown's sentencing, PC Mike McVay, from North Yorkshire Police, said: ""Brown's aggressive and dangerous driving caused serious injury to the victim. ""He also could so easily have placed the three children, the ponies and the other person who was with the group, at great risk of injury or worse."" Brown's driving licence was a privilege that had ""rightly been taken away"" from him, PC McVay added. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Jail for man found with details about soldier's car,"The court was told that following his arrest, he voiced support for dissident republican violence and told a probation officer that while not being actively involved, if the need arose he would be ""one of the first on the front line"". Justice O'Hara said that on 15 March, 2021 a call was made to the Impartial Reporter newspaper by a man claiming to represent the North Fermanagh Continuity IRA. The caller said shots had been fired at Enniskillen Police Station and a device left at Shore's Pass. Later that evening, the PSNI released a statement saying nothing untoward had been found and there had been no reports of shots being fired. A day later, police tracking Meehan's movements observed him near the Territorial Army centre in Enniskillen. The vehicle registration number of a soldier who drove out of the centre was later found in Meehan's possession when his home was searched later that month. He was also seen in the Lough Shore Path area of Enniskillen close to the police station on 16 March and the following day, a call was made to the Irish News detailing the location of an item in that area. When the location was searched by police the following day, officers located an improvised firearm. Meehan's County Fermanagh home was searched on 30 March and a piece of paper with the soldier's vehicle registration was found hidden in a void within an internal door. His home was searched again on 6 May, 2021 and on this occasion two mobile phones were seized. Found on these phones were images of the improvised weapon in the exact spot it was located by the PSNI on 17 March and in the same place Meehan had been seen at the previous day. Also found on the phone were photographs of Enniskillen Police Station as well as images and messages which the judge said ""revealed his support and sympathy for the use of violence to achieve a united Ireland"". Meehan - who has already spent 10 months in custody - will serve two thirds of his sentence in jail before his release is considered by parole commissioners. Following his release, he will spend an additional year on licence. Following the sentence, Det Supt Griffin of the PSNI's Terrorism Investigation Unit said officers from the unit ""remain totally committed to investigating and disrupting terrorist activity."" ""Our aim will always be to protect communities and keep people safe from harm, and we will continue, with your support, to tackle those intent on bringing weapons and violence to our doorstep,"" they added."
Jerseys first dementia strategy published,"The charity estimates 1,600 people are living with dementia in Jersey. One of those is Allan Johnson who was diagnosed with the condition four years ago and has shared his experience to help develop the strategy. He said he was a little bit sceptical because so much has been promised to other areas in the health department. Mr Johnson added support for dementia patients had improved and said: 'I am happy if somebody else has a better diagnosis because of the plans."" One of the other focuses of the strategy is providing better support for families and dementia carers. It took six years for Samantha Gleaves mother to be diagnosed and she said it was a frightening and lonely journey and she felt she had very little support. The plans for the new strategy had been delayed by a few weeks so the health minister could give the funding to implement the first year of the strategy. Ms Gleave added: Deputy Tom Binet has been so positive with this and I think the delay was a positive as there is no point having a strategy that sits on a shelf and gathers dust because there isnt the budget for it. Health Minister, Deputy Tom Binet, apologised to those in attendance at the launch but defended the delay to the strategy. He said it was important for people to know what we could do with the money available and we need to start investing in prevention for conditions like dementia. If we do not start tackling the problem at point source, we will end up with a bill that we simply can't afford, so dementia is one of the many areas that we need to start investing in upfront, Mr Binet added. Claudine Snape from Dementia Jersey was part of the project which heard from more than 550 people about their experiences to shape the strategy. She said there is a lot of optimism about the plans and it feels like Jersey is on the right track to becoming a positive place to live for people with dementia. Ms Snape said: We can all agree funding is still a big issue and hopefully we've made the economic and social case for why that funding is important because dementia is the fastest growing condition affecting over 65s on the island. The dementia strategy also plans to work with businesses and schools to raise more awareness about how to prevent developing the condition and helping those whove been diagnosed with it.

Journalists named in Harry's case against Mail publisher,"David Sherborne, the duke's barrister, said in the written claim: ""The claimant will contend that the information obtained by these private investigators on behalf of Associated and its journalists was unlawfully or illegally obtained, and was known or must have been known to be, or were obviously, to have been so obtained."" However, Mr Caldecott and Mr Beltrami said in the publisher's written defence that the duke's case was ""replete with sweeping allegations of serious criminal conduct which lack even the most basic of particulars"". They said ""it is denied that Associated's journalists widely and habitually carried out, or commissioned the carrying out of, illegal or unlawful information gathering activities"". A spokesperson from ANL said the publisher ""has filed a trenchant defence of its journalism"" against the claims. ""In papers submitted to the High Court, the publisher of the Daily Mail and the Mail On Sunday denied under oath that its journalists had commissioned or obtained information derived from phone hacking, phone tapping, bugging, computer or email hacking or burglary to order,"" a statement said. ""Associated also denied claims made by Prince Harry and Baroness Lawrence that it commissioned private investigators Gavin Burrows and Jonathan Rees, as well as claims by Sir Simon Hughes that it commissioned convicted phone hacker Glenn Mulcaire. ""Indeed, it is highly significant that Gavin Burrows has retracted a statement he allegedly gave to the claimants, on which their case appears to be based."" ANL said it ""stands by its previous statements"" that the claims are ""preposterous and without foundation"". It added that ""the stories concerned, many of which were published 20 or more years ago, and not subject to any complaint at the time, were the product of responsible journalism based on legitimate sources"". Spokespeople on behalf of the Sun, the Times and the Sunday Times declined to comment."
Judge gives teen burglar second chance,"The court heard the boy had a ""sharp implement"" with him  on 27 February when he confronted a woman in her home before fleeing. Four hours later he let himself into a man's unsecured house. He said he was under the influence of drugs at the time and could not really remember the incidents, but admitted aggravated burglary and burglary. Judge Smith said had the youth been aged in his 20s he could have been jailed for up to eight years. But the judge heard the boy had made good progress over the past four months in Wetherby YOI, including getting clean of drugs and engaging in education. Judge Smith said he was impressed with a ""very important"" letter the boy had written to his victims which began and ended with a ""very real apology"". The boy's mother also wrote a letter to the court in which she said he had been a ""good lad"" and ""pleasure to be around"" until he started smoking cannabis, which led to worse drugs. The woman said while her son's time in Wetherby YOI had been ""horrible"", he had stopped taking drugs and her son was ""back"". Judge Smith said: ""I can't think of a clearer case of illustrating how drugs are a really, really bad idea because they wreck lives."" The boy was given a two-year community order with intensive work with the probation service and a six-month overnight curfew. The judge said it was a very difficult case to sentence but he believed the boy would ""prove [him] right"", ""knuckle down"" and ""turn it around"". Judge Smith warned the boy he had been given a ""lucky break"", adding: ""Don't play the lottery for a few months because all your luck has run out today. ""Your new life starts now. Dont screw it up."" Follow BBC Tees on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram. Send your story ideas to northeastandcumbria@bbc.co.uk."
Judge orders Harry to explain missing messages,"""The position is not transparently clear about what happened,"" the judge said. He said the prince's exchanges with writer JR Moehringer on the Signal messaging app may have ""related to the parts of Spare in which unlawful information gathering in relation to newspapers was discussed"". NGN's legal team accused the duke of ""obfuscation"" but Prince Harry's barrister, David Sherborne, said in written arguments that the duke had not discussed unlawful information gathering via text or WhatsApp with anyone and that his Signal messages had been ""wiped"". Mr Justice Fancourt ruled that a wider search was required of Prince Harry's laptop, text and WhatsApp messages to look at exchanges from 2005 until early 2023. The duke was also ordered to produce a witness statement explaining how messages with his ghostwriter JR Moehringer were missing. News Group was awarded two-thirds of its costs, but the Duke of Sussexs legal team is disputing the £132,000 bill, arguing the amount is excessive for a one-day hearing. It comes after NGN's legal team had sought an order forcing Harry to disclose any information he had which would be relevant to what he knew about alleged unlawful behaviour before the end of 2013. NGN had argued that if the duke knew he had a potential claim before that date, then the case could be dismissed on the grounds it was filed too late. In April, the same court rejected NGN's request for a preliminary trial to help decide whether Prince Harry had left it too late. Under legal rules, claims usually have to be brought within six years, but many of these cases go back decades. But the claimants in the case argued NGN concealed evidence of phone hacking, making it impossible for them to sue sooner. NGN has already paid out hundreds of millions of pounds to the victims of phone hacking by News of the World and settled more than 1,300 lawsuits. The company has previously said the Sun does not accept liability or make any admissions to the allegations. Prince Harry's claim is one of a series of legal challenges he has brought against parts of the British press. Earlier this year, the duke settled his remaining phone hacking claims against Mirror Group Newspapers, which related to claims of unlawful intrusion on 115 stories."

Kate rumours linked to Russian disinformation,"In the days before Catherine revealed her cancer diagnosis in a video message, there had been a surge in online rumours and often wild claims about her health, adding to the emotional pressure on the princess and her husband Prince William. Now security experts analysing social media data say there were hallmark signs of a co-ordinated campaign sharing and adding to the false claims and divisive content, both in support of and criticising the Princess of Wales. The researchers say this is consistent with the previous patterns of a Russian disinformation group. The accounts involved were also spreading content opposing France's backing for Ukraine, suggesting a wider international context for the royal rumours. This particular foreign influence network has a track record in this area, with a focus on eroding support for Ukraine following Russia's invasion. The BBC had previously tracked down amateur sleuths and real social media users who started and drove speculation and conspiracy theories. Even without any artificial boost, these claims had been racking up millions of views and likes. And algorithms were already promoting this social media storm about the royals, without the intervention of networks of fake accounts. But Martin Innes, director of the Security, Crime and Intelligence Innovation Institute at Cardiff University, says his researchers found systematic attempts to further intensify the wave of rumours about the princess, with royal hashtags being shared billions of times across a range of social media platforms. Prof Innes has identified a Russian disinformation group involved in this. It's not a state entity, but it is linked to people who have been sanctioned recently in the United States over claims they were part of a ""malign influence campaign"" that spread fake news. ""Their messaging around Kate appears wrapped up in their ongoing campaigns to attack France's reputation, promote the integrity of the Russian elections, and denigrate Ukraine as part of the wider war effort,"" says Prof Innes. He says the operatives running this rumour machine would be seen in Russia as ""political technologists"". Their approach is to fan the online flames of an existing story - tapping into disputes and doubts that already exist - which Prof Innes says is a much more effective approach and harder to track than starting misinformation from scratch. He says they ""hijack"" popular claims and inject more confusion and chaos. It then becomes harder to separate the co-ordinated disinformation from individuals sharing conspiracies and chasing clicks. But the social media data, examined by the Cardiff University team, shows extreme spikes and the simultaneous sharing of messages in a way that they think is consistent with a network of fake accounts being operated. Dr Jon Roozenbeek, an expert in disinformation at King's College London, says such Russian involvement in conspiracy theories is ""topic agnostic"" - in that they don't really care about the subject, it can be anything that ""pushes buttons"" and adds to social tensions. He says they seek out ""wedge issues"" in an opportunistic way. Showing the scale of the challenge, TikTok says it took down more than 180 million fake accounts in just three months. Many of the accounts spreading the Catherine conspiracy theories were newly created this month, says Prof Innes. They fed off a so-called ""master"" account, which in this case had a name which was a version of ""master"", with a cascade of other fake accounts replying to and sharing messages and drawing in other users. Identical phrases - such as ""Why do these big media channels want to make us believe these are Kate and William?"" - were churned out by multiple accounts. Although real people are known to re-share the same message on their own accounts in this way - a tactic referred to ""copypasta"" - there are other clues about the accounts, which suggest a more organised network. Another phrase about Catherine was shared at the same time by what were ostensibly 365 different accounts on X, formerly Twitter. There were also new TikTok accounts, created in recent days, that seemed to put out nothing but royal rumours. The Cardiff researchers highlight an overlap with a Russia-linked fake news website, published in English, complete with a ""fact checked"" logo, which has a stream of ghoulish and bizarre stories about Catherine. Also UK embassies in Russia and Ukraine both had to put out fake news warnings last week about claims being circulated that King Charles was dead. When it comes to saying who is responsible for such disruptive activities, it can be difficult to attribute networks of accounts to a particular group, organisation or state. And further muddying the waters will be all kinds of individuals, interest groups and other overseas players commenting on social media on the same topic. Instead, experts in this field tend to rely on indications that a particular network is connected to an existing influence operation or particular group. Are their tactics the same? Does getting involved in this social media conversation align with their interests? For instance in this case, one clue was a Russia-sourced video which frequently appeared in the social media exchanges over Kate, and which had previously been identified with a particular disinformation group. This same group spreading rumours against Catherine had also been part of destabilising online campaigns in France, says Prof Innes. President Macron, who is seen as taking an increasingly tough line over Ukraine, has faced a blizzard of hostile personal rumours. France's state agency for tackling disinformation, Viginum, has warned of extensive networks of fake news being pumped out by Russia-linked websites and social media accounts. The Royal Family in the UK, including Prince William, has been outspoken in support of Ukraine since Russia's invasion. These foreign influence operations aim to erode public trust, to sow discord by amplifying and feeding conspiracy theories that are already there. That makes it much harder to track back, because there can be a combination of real people who start false claims and then inauthentic accounts which push them further. It might begin with ""internet sleuths"" asking genuine questions and then fake accounts turn it into a social media storm. Anna George, who researches extremism and conspiracy theories at the Oxford Internet Institute, says a characteristic of Russian disinformation is not to necessarily care what narrative is being sent out, as long as it spreads doubt about what is real and unreal: ""They want to sow confusion about what people can trust."" The royal rumours spread with an unusual speed, says Ms George, getting into the mainstream more quickly than most conspiracy theories, reflecting how any external influence was tapping into high levels of public curiosity. Prof Innes says engines of disinformation can also be a business proposition. His researchers identified the role of troll farms, thought to be in Pakistan, being hired to spread messages. In the wake of the video about Catherine's cancer treatment, there seems to be a change in mood online. While committed conspiracy theorists and sleuths continue to share evidence-free claims, lots of social media users have recognised the real harm caused to those at the centre of a frenzy like this. Last week users on X were being actively recommended content by the site's algorithms falsely suggesting a video of the Princess of Wales out shopping was really a body double. But CEO Linda Yaccarino has since said: ""Her request for privacy, to protect her children and allow her to move forward seems like a reasonable request to respect."" The Department for Science, Innovation and Technology says it would engage with disinformation where it presents a threat to UK democracy."

Kenya protesters traumatised by abductions - lawyer,"Some described how their phones and laptops were confiscated and they endured horrific experiences in dark rooms. ""Most of them are visibly shaken and they do not want to talk,"" Faith Odhiambo, the president of the Law Society of Kenya (LSK), told the BBC. The youth-led protests began last week, with thousands of demonstrators marching largely peacefully in the capital, Nairobi, and across the country against a controversial finance bill that would have increased taxes. But tensions flared sharply on Tuesday afternoon after police officers opened fire on protesters outside parliament which was breached by the crowds. At least 23 protesters were killed in the violence on Tuesday, according to a doctors' association The next day, President William Ruto bowed to pressure and said he would withdraw the bill, passed by MPs on Tuesday. He also reaffirmed his electoral promise to end state-instigated abductions as a political tool amid the wave of disappearances. His deputy, Rigathi Gachagua, blamed the polices National Intelligence Service (NIS) for the abductions. On Wednesday, Mr Ruto said that all abducted individuals had been released but rights groups dispute this - and Ms Odhiambo said as the president spoke 12 people were still missing. But two have [since] been located. One of them was yesterday found dumped in a tea plantation butt-naked,"" she said. Many of those released had no physical injuries but had been left so traumatised that they did not want to speak about their experience, the LSK president said. ""Some were left in plantations outside Nairobi, while others were thrown on the roadsides and left really shaken."" Some said they now just wanted to go to their village homes as they do not feel safe in the city and others spoke about leaving the country altogether, she added. Most of them are below the age of 30 and had been plucked from the streets or their homes by plain-clothed gunmen believed to be police officers. Most had been vocal about the anti-tax protests on X Spaces, a feature that allows users to host live audio conversations with others on the platform formerly known as Twitter. They said their abductors had asked them about their contribution to the protests and who was funding them. ""Some of them were asked who was giving them the protest ideas,"" Ms Odhiambo said. George Diano, one of the first abductees, in a post on X detailed some of the trauma he had undergone and asked people to pray for those who were still missing. ""It's never easy at the hands of those bloody animals. Many won't talk but they really do you dirt, Mr Diano said. Austin Omondi, a doctor popularly known as Ja Prado on social media, who had been organising blood donations for those injured during the protests, was also abducted. He was held for six hours and later released after doctors threatened to strike, Davji Atellah, the secretary general of the Kenya Medical Practitioners Pharmacists Dentists Union, told the BBC's Newsday programme. ""He has not talked since he came from custody because he was given threats against his life if he disclosed what took place when he was kidnapped,"" Mr Atellah said. The state-funded Kenya National Human Rights Commission said it had helped secure the release of more than 300 people who had been ""illegally detained"". It is thought this refers to people arrested while demonstrating. Chief Justice Martha Koome has condemned the abductions, saying they amounted to a direct assault on the rule of law. Earlier, the High Court approved the use of military force to restore order given how police were overwhelmed during the protests. A judge said that the military deployment was critical to protect government installations but gave the authorities two days to clarify how long the deployment would last, along with its rules of engagement. Mr Mwaura told the BBC the withdrawal of the finance bill was a ""huge blow to the government as it left a ""big hole"" in the budget. ""It is really a big setback,"" Mr Mwaura said, blaming ""misinformed"" Kenyans for opposing it.

Kidnapped British businessman Colin Armstrong freed in Ecuador,"Colin Armstrong, 78, was abducted on Saturday from a farm he owned near the city of Guayaquil. Mr Armstrong, who also owns the Forbidden Corner visitor attraction in the Yorkshire Dales, is the president of Ecuadorean agriculture firm Agripac. His spokesperson Leo Morris said Mr Armstrong was now with the police and authorities in Ecuador. Mr Morris, who manages Forbidden Corner as well as Mr Armstrong's affairs in the UK, said: ""The staff, tenants, farmers and friends of Colin are absolutely delighted at the news. It couldn't have come at a better time."" The businessman would be spending Christmas with his family in South America, he added. Mr Morris also praised the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, saying its staff had done ""a very good job"" of helping the family and keeping them updated. Posting on X, formerly Twitter, Chris Campbell, the British Ambassador in Ecuador, said he was ""delighted"" Mr Armstrong had been ""safely released"". According to a message from the Ecuadorean police, also posted on X, Mr Armstrong was found on a road near Manabi. Cesar Augusto Zapata Correa, Ecuador's police chief, posted: ""Our units released citizen Colin A, kidnapped a few days ago in Los Rios. At the moment he is safe and healthy."" He added that nine people had been arrested in connection with the kidnap. Mr Armstrong was awarded the OBE and Companions of the Order of St Michael and St George for services to the British Monarchy in 2011. He was a former UK honorary consul to Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, a voluntary role which involved supporting British interests and providing support to British nationals who found themselves in difficulty.

Kieran McKenna: Fermanagh footballers inspired by Ipswich promotion,"That's according to Mark Connolly, a coach at Enniskillen Town who coached Ipswich Town head coach Kieran McKenna as a teenager. Just 15 months after leaving League One, Ipswich will now be heading back to the Premier League under the guidance of the 37-year-old County Fermanagh man. On Saturday, they beat Huddersfield 2-0 at Portman Road. ""Kieran was different because he had talent - but he was also very driven"", according to Mr Connolly. ""He was very methodical - a great character - a great team player - but he had that wee bit extra about him. ""When the other kids were having a wee bit of fun - Kieran was doing extra work - training, doing sit-ups at the side of the pitch - and extra runs after games and things,"" he continued. ""It was very evident that he had that sort of tunnel vision and he wanted to succeed."" Mark added the children at Enniskillen Town now have a real affinity to Ipswich. That is something 10-year-old Noah, a player with Enniskillen Town agrees with. ""I play centre mid and I've learned from watching the Ipswich team about passing fast and movement,"" Noah explained. McKenna entered coaching after his playing career was cut short in his early 20s due to injury while at Tottenham Hotspur. He had represented Northern Ireland at youth level and went on to coach at both Spurs and Manchester United before making the move to Ipswich as manager in 2021. Murray, nine, plays right back for Enniskillen Town. For him, McKenna is a ""great manager"". ""I've learned from him that you need to pass. He's doing everything right. It's great to see someone from where we are doing so well."" Pat Harty, from Drogheda, has been an Ipswich Town fan since the 1970s. He now travels to Fermanagh to watch The Tractor Boys and said it's a long time since the team has been in the Premiership. ""The great thing about this is that it's an Irishman that's taken us back to the Premiership - and that's what makes it all the more sweet,' said Mr Harty. ""Kieran has done an absolutely fantastic job. It has been a lonely road being an Ipswich fan but I've noticed a lot of shirts popping up in the past couple of weeks. ""Everybody is going to be looking for Kieran McKenna now. Everybody wants to know Ipswich supporters now that we are on a high. The more supporters we have the better."""
Kinnock urges Labour to combat Reform's nationalism,"He said Reform have withdrawn support to candidates who made offensive comments, and in a TV debate on Friday he repeated his assertion that the footage broadcast by Channel 4 was a ""set-up"". ""You get people in all parties saying bad things and wrong things,"" he said during questions from a BBC Question Time audience, arguing it was partly the consequence of having to find candidates quickly. Lord Kinnock - the Labour leader from 1983 to 1992 - told the Guardian ""now"" was the time for his party to start targeting Reform. ""We have to combat this populist nationalism with words and explaining to people what these people are not just who they are. ""People like Farage, love the personal attention, like all narcissists, so we have to focus on explaining what they are, and all that inconsistencies and falsehoods, they plant and harvest lies"". Lord Kinnock added: ""The populist right have to be combated with actions that means the implementation of change which is positive and cumulative and driven by strong purpose in the service of community."" Reform UK said: ""Kinnocks Labour Party have abandoned the people of Wales to the twin Gods of political correctness and the net zero agenda. ""Their government in Cardiff Bay has shown us their incompetence in government, running the Welsh NHS into the ground, applauding their own moral perfections while exporting jobs and lives from their own traditional heartlands."" Welsh Labour said: ""Our volunteers and candidates are out campaigning every day to bring Labour's message of change to voters across Wales."" Speaking on Saturday for the Conservatives, Security Minister Tom Tugendhat said there was a ""pattern of racist and misogynistic views"" within Reform UK. BBC Wales has approached Lord Kinnock for an interview."

Korean web comic giant set for $2.7bn market debut,"Webtoon Entertainment, which describes itself as the world's largest web comic platform, has set its market value at $2.67bn (£2.11bn) ahead of its US listing. Its shares are due to start trading on the Nasdaq stock exchange on 27 June at $21 each, the top end of their marketed range. The Los Angeles-based company is owned by South Korean technology giant Naver, which has been boosted by the growing online popularity of Korean and Japanese comics. Webtoon says it has 170 million monthly active users in more than 150 countries around the world. The company is aiming to sell 15 million shares and raise $315m in the initial public offering (IPO). The world's largest fund manager BlackRock has expressed interest in buying up to $50m of shares. Webtoon Entertainment also owns the Japanese web comic and manga app Line Manga, the web novel platform Wattpad and the Korean web comic offering Naver Webtoon. It offers thousands of titles covering different genres - including action, romance, horror and science fiction. The webtoon industry, which focuses on online-only comics optimised for reading on mobile, first emerged in South Korea two decades ago. Their popularity exploded globally turning them into a major South Korean cultural phenomenon alongside K-pop and Korean dramas. Webtoons are cheap to produce - a single artist can create one using a tablet  - which can make popular comics very profitable. The webtoon industry made $4.7bn 2021 and is projected to grow to $60.1bn by 2030, according to Spherical Insights & Consulting."
LGBT troops on Ukraine's front line fight homophobia at home,"Attitudes to LGBT rights have shifted enormously over the past decade, as Ukraine has embraced European values, though many still hold socially conservative and even homophobic views. Having openly gay people fighting and dying on the front line has further challenged peoples prejudices. But meaningful change is harder to see. Hopes were high last spring, when a bill to allow same-sex couples to have civil partnerships was introduced to parliament, but 14 months later it has stalled. Meanwhile, LGBT soldiers have reported being bullied and harassed in their units. When Mariya Volya nearly died defending her hometown of Mariupol in 2022, now under Russian occupation, she decided it was time to come out. Although the 31-year-old had been serving in the army since 2015, the full-scale Russian invasion shifted her threshold for fear. Revealing her sexuality was no longer something she was afraid to reveal. Mariya posted her coming out on a TikTok account for LGBT soldiers. When her commander saw the post he told her to delete it. Then she received a torrent of online hate from anti-LGBT activists. Mariya transferred units and now works in the Donetsk region, near the eastern front, as a radio engineer for the 47th brigade. But still she has to field discriminatory comments. ""Why cant you form your own unit?"" some of her fellow soldiers ask. She continues to be harassed online and on the street, to the extent that sometimes she does not feel safe going out in her military uniform, lest she is recognised. But on 16 June, while on a break from the front line, Mariya put on her khaki camouflaged trousers, to attend the first Pride march to be held in Kyiv since the start of the invasion. Alongside her fiancée Diana, Mariya joined in the chorus chanting for victory and equality. We have two demands. More weapons and civil partnerships,"" the organisers shouted. Legalising gay marriage is not currently an option, as this requires changing the constitution, which is not possible while Ukraine is under martial law. I cant rule out something serious happening to me, and I want my fiancée to be provided for, to be protected,"" Mariya said. As she was speaking, Diana shifted uncomfortably and looked away. I dont like it when you talk like that,"" she said. But Diana understands the risk. When Mariya calls her from the front line, she can hear the explosions in the background. We like to keep in touch as much as we can, but I dont tell her everything Im experiencing,"" Mariya said, acknowledging it would scare her too much. Mariya and Diana were joined, in the lashing rain, by about a dozen LGBT soldiers. For some it was their first Pride march, and they had been given special permission by their commanders to attend for the day. This would have been unthinkable in 2021. One couple was using the parade to come out to their families and military units. This is a very emotional day for us,"" they told me, not ready to reveal their names publicly. We are proud weve been able to show people that there are lots of us gay soldiers, and that we are on the front lines defending Ukraine."" The BBC has asked Ukraines military about the treatment of LGBT soldiers, but has not yet received a response. Much of the work to increase the visibility of LGBT soldiers on the front line has been done by Viktor Pylypenko, the first openly gay soldier in the Ukrainian army, who went public about his sexuality in 2018. The combat medic built an online community, encouraging serving soldiers to share their experiences on Instagram, after noticing that when he told people who he rescued from small front-line villages that he was gay, they often became more accepting. Peoples attitudes are changing because theyve heard our stories. For example there are many gay soldiers operating the air-defence systems in Kyiv and people are so grateful to them,"" he said. Viktor acknowledges that his community has been given a helping hand by Vladimir Putin, who, in his fixation with promoting traditional family values, has made homophobia part of his ideology. Ukrainians want to resist him any way they can. This is a war of values, and people understand that if we want to continue our integration into Europe, to join the EU, to join Nato, then we should embrace liberal values,"" Viktor said. But still, the opposition to change is fierce. The Pride event was tightly policed, partly so as not to become a Russian target, but also because of the danger posed by anti-LGBT groups, which have disrupted the marches every year. Only 500 people were allowed to attend. Limited to a small patch of pavement, which had been cordoned off and surrounded by police vans, the marchers managed just a few dozen steps before being ushered underground into the metro, as far-right counter-protesters swooped in, chanting violent homophobic slurs. The group of people who are against us is small, but they are loud, and they are becoming more active,"" said Viktor before boarding a train. He did not feel safe to return above ground. A similar scenario is playing out in parliament. There, the bill on civil partnerships has been blocked by a committee of MPs following pressure from church leaders, according to the lawmaker Inna Sovsun, who introduced the legislation last year. In parts of Ukraine, homophobia is reinforced by religious beliefs. ""Unfortunately, what we're seeing is that the parliament is more conservative than society, and rather than listening to the public, the politicians are responding to the churches, who are not the majority, but who are very vocal,"" said Ms Sovsun. One member of the legal affairs committee, where the bill is currently held up, told the BBC that the majority of the committee members oppose the legislation, and are being guided by concerns from churches and their constituents. MP Mykola Stefanchuk said the bills supporters are now trying to win its opponents around. LGBT soldiers and activists are now coming to terms with the possibility the war might not provide the window for change they had hoped for. The day after the march, Viktor felt sick. He had convinced himself homophobic protests were a thing of the past. But Mariya and Diana were already disillusioned. When the bill was first launched, Mariya, filled with hope, had written letters to MPs. But she said she gave up as the process dragged on. Its going to be a long road, I think."" Additional reporting by Thanyarat Doksone, Hanna Tsyba and Anastasiia Levchenko One corner of Kyivs symbolic central square is now carpeted in thousands of tiny blue and yellow flags, in tribute to Ukraines fallen soldiers. Earlier this month, a group of activists gathered to add a different type of flag to the ever-growing collection. They had unicorns in their centre, to represent each gay soldier that had been killed in the war. The deaths of LGBT soldiers in Ukraine have exposed an inequality. They do not have the same rights as heterosexual troops. Gay marriage is illegal, meaning when these soldiers are killed, their partners do not have the right to decide what happens to their bodies, nor are they entitled to state support. A 30-year-old costume designer, Rodion, had come to plant a flag in honour of his former boyfriend Roman, who was killed in the early months of the invasion, the day before his 22nd birthday. Roman and five others from his brigade died in a missile attack near Kupiansk, close to Kharkiv, after a local family leaked their position to the Russians. All this death, all this blood, its the same, whether youre heterosexual or homosexual,"" Rodion said, but he was abruptly cut short by the familiar whir of air raid sirens. See? he continued, pointing to the sky. ""Missiles can kill us in the same way they can everyone else."" The war has injected an urgency into the fight for equality. Ive waited 30 years, I cant wait another 30, because I cant guarantee Ill be alive when this ends,"" Rodion said. Attitudes to LGBT rights have shifted enormously over the past decade, as Ukraine has embraced European values, though many still hold socially conservative and even homophobic views.

Labour sets out energy plans in Great Yarmouth,"Former Labour leader Ed Miliband has promised a raft of renewable energy jobs backed by apprenticeships on a visit to a coastal college. The shadow energy secretary was joined by the shadow education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, at East Norfolk Sixth Form College in Gorleston, near Great Yarmouth, to highlight a pledge to revive engineering and manufacturing apprenticeships. ""Talking to young people at the college, they see the potential of renewable energy, but that potential is not being full realised under the Conservatives,"" said Mr Miliband. However, Peter Aldous for the Conservatives, who has raised energy issues for the East in Parliament, said: ""We are seeing people coming to work here and also local people getting those jobs in those new emerging businesses."" During the visit, Mr Miliband and Ms Phillipson said renewable energy was vital to  economic growth, and shared plans on their promise to create 650,000 jobs in the energy sector. Many of these jobs would be based along the East Coast, where lots of potential was being missed by the government, said Mr Miliband. ""We have a ban on onshore wind in England - that's driving people's bills up by £180 a year,"" said Mr Miliband. ""They're sending bad signals on a whole range of areas around Net Zero - that's putting off investors. ""When I talk to business, I know they want clarity of direction which a Labour government will offer."" The party's jobs plan would be supported by a proposal to set up ""technical excellence colleges"" to focus on training in welding, engineering and the production and maintenance of offshore wind turbines. But the Conservatives have said the offshore renewable industry had grown rapidly over the last 14 years of its tenure and thousands of jobs had already been created. ""The speed with which it has accelerated and which it has now firmly established as part of the UK energy mix has, in many ways, taken people by surprise and that's probably why we have work to do on the infrastructure,"" said Mr Aldous. Regarding Sizewell, Mr Miliband added that he believed investors could be found, while on the issue of pylons he insisted that although Labour would listen to residents, the energy infrastructure must be built.

Lack of police escort prompts charity ride fears,"The event started in 2006 and has raised money for several charities in the north-east of England.

Laptops and SIM cards to be handed out to residents,"Hundreds of laptops and SIM cards are to be handed out to disadvantaged families as part of a council campaign to help them get online. The initiative by Trafford Council will see the refurbished devices offered for £60 to low-income residents in the Greater Manchester borough. They will be distributed through a series of community pop-up shops that will open across Trafford from next week. Councillor Liz Patel said the scheme would help ""bridge the gap"" for those who could not afford to get ""suitable access to devices to get online"". The 'Tech4All' initiative will see 250 discounted devices made available, alongside free SIM cards and low-cost broadband plans. A Trafford Council spokesman said much of the tech had been donated by Virgin Media O2. Those who want to buy one of the devices must provide proof of address to show they live in Trafford. Those applying must also demonstrate they are receiving some financial support such as Universal Credit or housing benefits. Ms Patel said it was ""very important"" that all residents had online access so they could stay connected and look for work.

Last surviving Blackburn Beverley plane heads to museum,"The 36-tonne aircraft, which has a wingspan of 162ft (50m) and was capable of carrying up to 100 troops, will be dismantled and taken by lorry to Cumbria, where it will take pride of place at the museum near Carlisle.

Le Pen threatens to challenge Macron's army powers,"As president, Mr Macron is commander in chief and traditionally plays a key role in his country's international and defence policy. He has been among Europe's strongest leaders in support of Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion, and he has refused to rule out sending troops ""if Russia decided to go further"", stressing that Russia cannot win in Ukraine. He has since been backed by a handful of other countries. But Ms Le Pen has told local newspaper Le Télégramme she believes that if National Rally (RN) leader Jordan Bardella becomes France's next prime minister then the president's powers would be reduced. ""Jordan has no intention of picking a quarrel with him but he has put down red lines - the president won't be able to send troops,"" she explained. If RN wins an absolute majority in parliament, she says Mr Macron would have little choice but to appoint her party's 28-year-old leader. That would mean power-sharing - known in France as cohabitation - between a president and government from a separate party, not seen in the country since 2002. Without the 289 seats needed for an absolute majority in the National Assembly, Mr Bardella has said he will not be prime minister of a hung parliament. The latest opinion poll - with a sizeable sample of almost 12,000 voters - suggests National Rally could win a potential 36% of the vote, reinforced by a number of candidates it is backing from the conservative Republicans. The deputy head of pollster Ipsos, Brice Teinturier, says the poll shows ""an incredibly powerful RN bloc"". With the vote only three days away, one of France's biggest sporting figures, Victor Wembanyama, has spoken out about the election. ""Of course, political choices are personal,"" the 19-year-old NBA basketball star told reporters. ""But for me it is important to take a distance from extremes, which are not the direction to take for a country like ours."" Last week France football captain Kylian Mbappé called on young voters to reject ""extremists"", who he said were ""at the gates of power"". The left-wing New Popular Front is lying in second place beyond National Rally, and Mr Macron's Ensemble alliance is trailing in third. Macron ally François Bayrou has accused Ms Le Pen of questioning the president's powers under the French constitution of appointing the state's civil and military positions, presiding over the armed forces and defence council. Ms Le Pen went on X to say she was not calling into question the president's power to send troops abroad, merely that the prime minister ""has by control of the budget, the means to oppose it"". Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed confidence that France will continue to support Kyiv after the elections and the next government will ""continue to comprehensively support Ukraine both on the battlefield and on our historically irreversible path to the EU"". Jordan Bardella said in a head-to-head TV debate this week that his party would continue supporting Ukraine, but would not send long-range missiles or French troops. The RN has long had close ties with Russia, and changed its position when the Russian invasion took place in 2022. Mr Macron has been widely criticised for calling the two-round parliamentary elections out of the blue earlier this month, an hour after it became clear that Mr Bardella's party had won European elections. Several of his own allies have openly challenged his decision to call snap elections, and Prime Minister Gabriel Attal has been left to fight a campaign when his Ensemble alliance's poll ratings are struggling. The high cost of living is seen as the main issue for voters, although immigration is not far behind, which is a big focus of National Rally's programme."

Letby denies further targeting baby to mislead staff,"Former nurse Lucy Letby has denied she further targeted a baby girl to mislead her colleagues into believing the infant was dislodging her own breathing tube. The 34-year-old convicted killer is on trial accused of the attempted murder of the girl, referred to as Baby K, at the Countess of Chester Hospital on 17 February 2016. She is accused of deliberately dislodging the baby's breathing tube while working a night shift at the neo-natal unit. Giving evidence for a second day at Manchester Crown Court, Letby denied tampering with the tube on two more occasions that evening. Jurors have previously been told she was convicted last August of the murders of seven babies and the attempted murders of six others at the hospital between June 2015 and June 2016. But a retrial was ordered after a verdict could not be reached on the allegation of attempted murder concerning Baby K. Prosecutors alleged Letby deliberately dislodged the infant's breathing tube and was said to have ""done nothing"" by consultant paediatrician Dr Ravi Jayaram as Baby's K's condition deteriorated when he walked into the unit at about 03.45 GMT. In the hours that followed on the same shift, the prosecution allege she interfered with replacement tubes for the newborn on two more occasions in a bid to cover her tracks. Baby K was transferred to a specialist hospital later on February 17, 2016, because of her extreme prematurity. She died there three days later, although the prosecution does not allege Letby caused her death. Letby, who wore a black suit with a navy blue and white polka dot top, has denied she harmed Baby K in any way. Cross-examining her, Nick Johnson KC said: ""You tried to kill her didn't you?"" Letby replied: ""No, I did not."" Mr Johnson put it to the former nurse that she ""tried to create the impression that [Baby K] was habitually desaturating and dislodging her own tube, didn't you?"" ""No,"" said Letby. She agreed that Baby K had been given an infusion of morphine after 04:00. Mr Johnson said: ""Do you accept the fact she was sedated with morphine meant she would not have been active?"" Letby said: ""She would be relaxed but she could have moved if she wanted to."" A portable X-ray machine was brought into the neo-natal unit shortly before 06.10 to record a scan for Baby K, the court heard, which showed the breathing tube in the correct position. Up to 15 minutes later the baby desaturated again as the prosecution suggested Letby went into nursery one to return some notes to the infant's cot side. Mr Johnson said: ""Those two events are connected, aren't they?"" ""No,"" said Letby. Mr Johnson said: ""Just as later on [Baby K] collapsed for a third time when you were there, didn't she?"" Letby said: ""According to the staff accounts, yes. I don't have any recollection of it myself."" Letby was said to have shouted for help and was seen to use a breathing device on Baby K when her fellow nurses came into nursery one at about 07.30. Mr Johnson asked: ""Do you accept what they say?"" Letby said: ""I think that sounds like actions I would be taking if it was happening."" Mr Johnson went on: ""So you do accept it?"" Letby replied: ""I don't think I can comment on whether someone is telling the truth or not. I only know what I know."" The prosecutor pointed out that Letby's two designated babies on the shift were in nursery two ahead of the morning handover to the day shift. He asked: ""Why were you in nursery one?"" Letby said: ""I can't tell you that but Joanne [Baby K's designated nurse] was not in the room at that time. Somebody would have to be in the room."" Mr Johnson said: ""Because she was not there you took the opportunity to destabilise [Baby K] for a third and final time, didn't you?"" ""No,"" said Letby. Mr Johnson said: ""[Baby K] was well sedated by this stage, wasn't she?"" Letby said: ""She was on morphine, yes."" The breathing tube was found to have moved a fifth of the way in from where a doctor had placed it, jurors heard. Mr Johnson said: ""Relatively speaking, a long way?"" ""Yes,"" said Letby. Mr Johnson said: ""That's because you pushed it in, didn't you?"" Letby replied: ""No."" Mr Johnson reminded jurors that a nursing expert had told the court the incident should have been reported verbally by Letby to Baby K's designated nurse and written up in the nursing notes. He asked Letby: ""Why didn't you record this event?"" Letby said: ""I can't answer that."" Mr Johnson said: ""I will offer an answer for you. Because you didn't want there to be a written record of your involvement in this third extubation of this extremely premature child."" Letby said: ""I disagree. If I had been involved any of the nurses would have written I had been involved."" Mr Johnson said: ""You tried to kill [Baby K], didn't you?"" ""No,"" said Letby. Mr Johnson said: ""Just like you tried to kill six other babies."" ""No,"" said Letby. Mr Johnson said: ""And succeeded in murdering seven other babies."" ""No"" said Letby. The trial continues.

Letby denies trying to harm any baby in her care,"Former nurse Lucy Letby has told a jury she has never intended or tried to harm any baby in her care. The 34-year-old is accused of attempting to murder a baby girl at the Countess of Chester Hospital on 17 February 2016. Jurors at Manchester Crown Court have been told Letby was convicted last August by another jury of the murders of seven babies and the attempted murders of six others, but a verdict could not be reached on the allegation involving an infant referred to as Baby K. Giving evidence for the first time during the latest trial, she denied attempting to harm the baby in any way. The prosecution claim consultant paediatrician Dr Ravi Jayaram walked into the neonatal unit's intensive care nursery room, less than two hours after Baby K's birth, and saw Letby standing next to the incubator ""doing nothing"", as the baby's blood oxygen levels dipped but no monitor alarms sounded. Ben Myers KC, defending, asked Letby: ""Did you attempt to murder [Baby K]?"" Letby replied: ""No."" Mr Myers said: ""Did you intend to do her any harm at all?"" ""No,"" she repeated. Mr Myers said: ""Do you accept you have ever intended to hurt any baby in your care?"" Letby replied: ""No, I don't."" Letby told the court she did not recall the particular events said to have taken place in nursery one, the intensive care room. Mr Myers said: ""You know the allegation, based on the evidence of Dr Jayaram, is that he says he came in and [Baby K] was desaturating and you were standing there doing nothing and no alarm was sounding, you understand that?"" ""Yes,"" said Letby. Mr Myers said: ""Do you recall any incident where Dr Jayaram comes in when something like that was happening?"" Letby replied: ""No."" Mr Myers said: ""Do you recall saying that [Baby K] had just started to desaturate?"" ""No,"" said Letby. Mr Myers said: ""Do you remember being there at all at that time in those circumstances?"" Letby repeated: ""No."" Mr Myers said: ""Was there any incident that morning where you were trying to hurt [Baby K]? ""No,"" said Letby. Mr Myers said: ""When you say you don't recall an incident like the one Dr Jayaram describes, by doing so do you accept that it happened?"" ""No,"" said Letby. Mr Myers said: ""Why were you searching for [Baby K's surname] on your Facebook a little over two years after this event is said to have taken place?"" Letby replied: ""I'm not sure. I don't have recollection of doing that at the time or now why I did."" Mr Myers said: ""Is it linked to any attempt to do her harm?"" Letby said: ""No."" Baby K was later transferred to a specialist hospital because of her extreme prematurity. She died three days later, although the prosecution does not allege Letby caused her death. Letby, originally of Hereford, denies a single count of attempted murder. Opening the case, prosecutor Nick Johnson KC alleged Letby was also responsible for two further desaturations of Baby K during the same shift in a bid to give her colleagues the impression the infant was habitually displacing her own breathing tube. Mr Myers said: ""The allegation is that some time after 6.10am [Baby K] has a desaturation which you caused by interfering with the tube. Did you do that?"" Letby said: ""No, I didn't."" Mr Myers said: ""Did you try to interfere with her tube to make it look like she was unwell and desaturating for no apparent reasons?"" Letby said: ""Absolutely not."" Mr Myers said: ""To try to cover your tracks?"" ""No,"" said Letby. Mr Myers then went through Letby's answers to detectives when she was questioned about Baby K following her arrest. The barrister asked Letby about a detective asking her, 'Explain what you were doing when Dr Jayaram walked into the nursery'. Mr Myers continued: ""The question is put to you like a fact. Had you actually agreed you were there in the first place?"" ""No,"" Letby replied. Mr Myers continued quoting a detective's question to Letby, telling the court they said: ""Tell me what would have happened if Dr Jayaram had not walked in when you were stood by the incubator."" He asked Letby: ""Have you ever agreed there was ever a time when he walked in to see you stood by the incubator?"" Letby replied: ""No."" Mr Myers said: ""Do you remember anything like that happening?"" ""No,"" Letby replied again. Mr Myers said the police officer then asked Letby why she did not ""call for help"" when the baby's oxygen levels began to fall. He continued: ""Were you agreeing you were there in the first place to call for help?"" ""No,"" Letby again said. Mr Myers asked why Letby had suggested Baby K may have ""self corrected"" with time after her oxygen levels had dropped. Letby said: ""I was trying to be helpful at the time. They were asking me questions, which I believed were factually correct."" Mr Myers said: ""Do you accept you were in the nursery not helping [Baby K]?"" Letby replied: ""No, I don't."" Mr Johnson, cross-examining, asked Letby: ""What were you doing on Facebook on April 20 2018?"" Letby said: ""From my notes I looked up [Baby K's surname] on Facebook."" Mr Johnson said: ""When [Baby K] left the Countess of Chester she didn't have a first name, did she? ""I think she had been named when she left. That's why you were searching for [Baby K's surname] wasn't it?"" Letby said: ""I don't recall why I was searching."" Mr Johnson said: ""Just like you don't recall whether you were in nursery one at about 3.45am?"" Letby said: ""No, I don't recall."" Mr Johnson said: ""If a nurse deliberately displaced the ET [endrotracheal] tube of a child of [Baby K's] gestation, what would likely happen?"" Letby replied: ""That's a hypothetical question."" Mr Johnson said: ""Why would you not displace an ET tube?"" Letby said: ""Because you would have no need to. That tube is there for that baby to breathe."" Mr Johnson said: ""Why would you not displace it?"" Letby said: ""It would cause harm to a baby. They couldn't breathe without that tube."" Mr Johnson said: ""Do you agree that you are likely to kill that baby if you did that deliberately?"" ""Yes,"" said Letby. Mr Johnson said: ""Would you agree that the baby is more likely to die if you don't try to do something about it quickly?"" ""Yes,"" repeated Letby. Mr Johnson said: ""And doing something like that to a child of [Baby K's] age is likely to kill them or at least severely compromise their prospects of survival?"" Letby replied: ""Yes, any baby."" Mr Johnson said: ""Particularly a baby of [Baby K's] gestational age?"" ""Yes,"" said Letby. Mr Johnson said: ""And that's what you did, isn't it?"" ""No,"" said Letby. Mr Johnson said: ""You actually did it three times, didn't you?"" ""No,"" said Letby. Mr Johnson said: ""Does it come to this, because you are saying you are not the sort of person that kills babies, you would not do that?"" Letby said: ""I know my actions and I know I didn't displace that tube."" Mr Johnson said: ""But you are just that sort of person, aren't you?"" ""No,"" said Letby. Mr Johnson said:"" You have killed seven babies in that unit, haven't you?"" Letby said: ""No, I have not."" Mr Johnson said: ""And you tried to kill six others, one on two separate occasions, didn't you?"" ""No,"" said Letby. Mr Johnson said: ""Therefore what Dr Jayaram says cannot be right, is that your case?"" Letby said: ""Yes. I didn't dislodge any tube."" Mr Johnson said: ""Are you suggesting he is not telling the truth?"" Letby said: ""I don't think I comment on whether he is telling the truth, I just know that didn't happen."" The trial continues.

Library invites 90-year-olds to mark  90th birthday,"A landmark city library is looking for 90-somethings to help celebrate its 90th birthday. Manchester Central Library is hosting a celebration on 17 July - to mark the day it was officially opened by King George V, 90 years ago, in 1934. Librarians are looking for Mancunians in their ninth decade to attend the event, and are urging local nonagenarians, or their relatives, to contact the venue. We could not miss the opportunity to invite residents who are celebrating their 90th birthdays to help share this very special occasion,"" said Councillor John Hacking, executive member for leisure, skills and employment at Manchester City Council. The library's foundation stone was laid in 1930 by the-then Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald. At its opening, four years later, it was the largest local authority library in Britain. Speaking at the opening, in 1934, the King said the substantial library would ensure magnificent opportunities for further education, and for the pleasant use of leisure. Over the years, the library -  in Manchester's St Peter's Square - has been a focus for political gatherings and protest movements, as well as a hub for cultural events. Mr Hacking said the civic building was one of the most visited public libraries in the country and is loved by residents and visitors alike. Anniversary celebrations began in May, with hundreds of families attending a Blue Peter Book Club Live event. Children can find the Blue Peter Book Club booklist in parks and open spaces around the city, as part of a series of Book Hunt events over the summer.

Library roles cut ahead of new opening hours,"UNISON, the union, said the consultation process had been ""extremely stressful"" for staff and ""destroyed their morale"". Dorset branch secretary Becky Brookman said: ""Library workers with caring responsibilities and transport difficulties are those hardest hit by the job losses. ""The council has failed to consider the impact on a workforce of mainly low-paid women, many of them part-time, who are devastated to lose the jobs they love."" Dorset Council said it regularly met with union representatives and responded to feedback raised by the workforce and union members. It said 161 posts were directly affected, which equated to 83.86 full-time jobs. After the transformation there will be 135 new posts, equivalent to 91.70 full-time. A spokesperson said: ""We have increased the number of hours across support and front-line roles. However, this reflects a reduction of 26 posts."" Culture councillor Ryan Hope previously told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) that all employees ""had the opportunity, and were actively encouraged and supported, to apply for permanent and newly revised roles"". ""I have been given assurance that our libraries management and HR teams are supporting all individuals through this change,"" he said. The new opening hours for Dorset's 23 libraries will come into effect on Monday 1 July. Hundreds of people have signed a petition urging the council to reverse the changes in Swanage where Saturday opening hours will be cut from six and a half hours to three. Dorset Council said the new timings were ""based on community feedback and identified community needs"" and the number of staffed hours across the library network would remain almost the same, totalling 630 hours instead of 631.

Liquid air energy storage plant to create 700 jobs,"Work has begun on a £300m energy plant which will store surplus electricity from wind and solar farms in the form of liquid air. The facility at Carrington near Manchester, designed by Highview Power, will create more than 700 jobs in the north-west of England, the firm said. The energy stored at the site, which is expected to be operational by 2026, will then be put back into the grid at times of high demand. Highview Power's co-founder Richard Butland said this kind of long-term clean energy storage was ""huge for Britain and huge globally"". The facility has been described as the UK's first commercial scale liquid air energy storage plant, and could have the capacity to power 480,000 homes. Energy compressed into air, liquified and then cryogenically frozen can be held at the plant for several weeks, which is longer than battery storage. ""Done at large-scale makes this cost effective"", Mr Butland told BBC Radio Manchester. The technology has been developed by Highview Power over a number of years with financial support from the government and other energy firms. A group including energy giant Centrica, the owners of British Gas, and the state-owned UK Infrastructure Bank have invested £300m to get the project off the ground. Mr Butland, who is also Highview Power's chief executive, said there were times when the UK grid had ""lots of excess when there is no demand"". The plant will be the ""largest facility of its kind globally"" that could store this energy over a longer period, he added. Carrington was a ""perfect area"" for the facility as it was close to the windfarms in the Irish Sea and Scotland, he added. Mr Butland said the jobs created would include construction, supply chain and staff. Highview Power also wants to develop a delivery hub in Manchester as part of aims to roll out the technology across the UK. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham welcomed the plans and said the storage facility would be a ""huge boost for the region"" in terms of jobs, investment and renewable energy.

Litter-picking group finds 1990s crisp packet,"The group organises regular litter picks and is occasionally joined by the Peterborough Litter Wombles Association. Over the years, the volunteer-run wombles group has collected wine bottles priced in old money, Marathon chocolate bars, which has been called Snickers since 1990, and rusted Coca-Cola cans dating back to 1978. Harry Machin, from the group, said: We find old things and odd things all the time, including rusted cans, dozens of golf balls. We found 88 nitrous oxide canisters at one point and even a kitchen sink. There is a lot of rubbish in the undergrowth especially around the citys parkways. It is almost as if they have never been cleared so its satisfying to clean them. It makes me feel really good to know we are clearing out decades-old rubbish but seeing newer litter makes me very angry. Laura Hutchings, projects and data manager at Recoup, said It has been really interesting to see the variety of both new and legacy litter we have been collecting from each litter pick. There is an obvious need for highly thought-out, targeted interventions for the prevention of litter, and this project will provide key data and insights to help achieve this. The group said the crisp packet has been stored in a bag and would not be disposed of. Follow Peterborough news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

Lock of Florence Nightingale's hair up for auction,"Jody Beighton, who works as an auctioneer and valuer, said the item was ""quite a rarity"" and of ""cast iron provenance"". ""It has been consigned by a member of the Verney family,"" he said. ""Harry Verney was actually married to Florence Nightingale's sister, so it comes down the family line by descent."" From the note that came with the lock of hair, Mr Beighton said the auctioneers could only assume it was from 1883. The auctioneer said taking locks of hair was a common practice to remember departed loved ones, so it was a little unusual for the lock to have been cut 27 years before her death in 1910. Nightingale  is seen by many as the founder of modern nursing. She became known as the ""Lady with the Lamp"" during the Crimean War. The Times newspaper reported of her patrolling the wards of the Scutari Hospital at night, checking on wounded personnel. She established the Nightingale Training School at St Thomas' Hospital in 1860. This became the first institute of its kind and deployed nurses across the UK to spread her ideas in the field. She died in 1910 at the age of 90. When it came to valuing the lot, Mr Beighton said it took a lot of people ""throwing their ideas in the hat"". ""We've all seen lots of things over the years, through working at different places, but it was a difficult one to value,"" he said. The figure they came up with was ""somewhere on the conservative side,"" he said. ""The sky is the limit I suppose with something like this, you won't find another one."" He added that despite only being online for a few days, a lot of interest had already been shown from history enthusiasts. Firm bids suggested it had already reached its valuation estimate. ""This is probably the most weird and wonderful item I've seen in a long time,"" Mr Beighton said. nan Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

London Grammar on their Glastonbury clash with SZA and The National,"Youre one of the last bands to play this weekend. Will you turn up early and see the sights? Oh no. If I was on site all weekend, I'd probably end up running away! How come? The atmosphere would be too much. You wouldn't sleep, so youve got to protect yourself if youve got a show unless youre crazy. This is this your first time on one of the outdoor stages. How are you feeling? Do you want the official answer or the truth? Lets have both! The interview answer is, I'm feeling pumped. I'm so excited. This is a new era of London Grammar. And the real answer is Im severely terrified. Its like 10 per cent excited, 90 per cent terrified at the moment. Why the nerves? It just means so much to us, as a band. It's not just a regular festival set. For some reason, we see this as one of the most important shows in our career. We've rehearsed so much and Ive worked on my voice so that were the best we can possibly be. nan There's such a beauty to your music, even when it's melancholy. Do you ever look out from the stage and see people making out? Not really. I get a lot of tears in the front row, though. How does that affect your performance? Do you absorb their emotion? I think I do. And I think that used to contribute to my nerves. They're very emotional songs for me, obviously, and when people get emotional too, I've definitely cried on stage. And it kind of made for a good show, once or twice, but you cant do it every night. So now, if there's someone whos clearly going through a breakup, I'll have to look away. Your recent single, House, is all about drawing boundaries for yourself. What were you going through when you wrote that? I mean, some stuff I can't tell you about! But theres a lyric, I cannot be invisible, and its saying that you need to be your authentic self, no matter what the consequences of that are. I mean, unless you're just like going around being a massive [expletive]. You obviously shouldn't be that. But it's about not fitting in with other people's versions of you. You've spoken previously about the sexism you've witnessed and experienced in the music industry  but looking at the gender balance at this years Glastonbury do you think things are finally improving, however slowly? I think so. Maybe I'd have to speak to younger artists who are coming up now - because I think that, when you are a woman in your 30s, you get to a place where you've dealt with it. It's more like water off a duck's back, if you know what I mean. But I do feel that there has been a massive shift and I think it's incredible. The Glastonbury line-up is incredible, the highest grossing tour currently is Taylor Swift. I feel like female artists are being celebrated more. nan Your new album is coming out just three years after Californian Soil. Do you realise  thats the shortest ever gap between London Grammar albums? I know! Somebody else said that to me the other day and it's funny - because we've had a lot going on but we've managed to get into this really amazing rhythm. Just a really prolific patch of time. Are some of these songs held over from Californian Soil, or is it all brand new? Nothing is held over from Californian Soil - but there are a couple of songs that have been around in the ether for years and years and years, and we could just never get them right. You And I is one of them, and Into Gold is another one. Sometimes one of us will be going through our laptop and we'll find an old demo and think, What the hell is this? It's really good. So with those two songs, they are actually very old - just rewritten and reproduced.  I guess we just couldn't give them what they needed at the time. The curfew on the Park Stage is quite early  so will you dash off to watch the end of SZA or The Nationals sets? So, The National and SZA are two of my  favourite acts ever but I have a child now, so I might have to just go home and take care of him. But yeah, its funny for me, those two clashes. I'm going to be trying to focus on our own show, while seeing if I can like hear SZA and The National floating over on the breeze. You can just stop your show and sing along. Exactly. England is my favourite National song, so I could just harmonise along with them. London Grammar are one of Glastonbury's Sunday night headliners, bringing their cinematic, moody electro-pop music to the festival's beloved Park Stage. The set comes months before the release of their fourth album, The Greatest Love, in September, with fans looking forward to the prospect of hearing their first new material since 2021. Formed in the dorm rooms of Nottingham University by singer Hannah Reid and guitarist Dan Rothman, they've gone on to sell more than three million records, including their double-platinum debut album If You Wait. They've topped the bill at Glastonbury before, headlining the smaller Woodsies tent in 2014, but this will be their first time playing outdoors. But Reid, who gave birth to her first son six months ago, has wisely avoided stepping foot on Worthy Farm so far. ""I've been in a bubble in my hotel room,"" she says. ""All that pollen plays havoc with your throat."" From the safety of her bubble, the singer told us what to expect from London Grammar's set, why she has to block out crying fans, and what it's like to be scheduled against two of her favourite bands. Youre one of the last bands to play this weekend. Will you turn up early and see the sights? Oh no. If I was on site all weekend, I'd probably end up running away! How come?

It just means so much to us, as a band. It's not just a regular festival set. For some reason, we see this as one of the most important shows in our career. We've rehearsed so much and Ive worked on my voice so that were the best we can possibly be. nan There's such a beauty to your music, even when it's melancholy. Do you ever look out from the stage and see people making out? Not really. I get a lot of tears in the front row, though. How does that affect your performance? Do you absorb their emotion? I think I do. And I think that used to contribute to my nerves. They're very emotional songs for me, obviously, and when people get emotional too, I've definitely cried on stage. And it kind of made for a good show, once or twice, but you cant do it every night. So now, if there's someone whos clearly going through a breakup, I'll have to look away. Your recent single, House, is all about drawing boundaries for yourself. What were you going through when you wrote that? I mean, some stuff I can't tell you about! But theres a lyric, I cannot be invisible, and its saying that you need to be your authentic self, no matter what the consequences of that are. I mean, unless you're just like going around being a massive [expletive]. You obviously shouldn't be that. But it's about not fitting in with other people's versions of you. You've spoken previously about the sexism you've witnessed and experienced in the music industry  but looking at the gender balance at this years Glastonbury do you think things are finally improving, however slowly? I think so. Maybe I'd have to speak to younger artists who are coming up now - because I think that, when you are a woman in your 30s, you get to a place where you've dealt with it. It's more like water off a duck's back, if you know what I mean. But I do feel that there has been a massive shift and I think it's incredible. The Glastonbury line-up is incredible, the highest grossing tour currently is Taylor Swift. I feel like female artists are being celebrated more. nan Your new album is coming out just three years after Californian Soil. Do you realise  thats the shortest ever gap between London Grammar albums? I know! Somebody else said that to me the other day and it's funny - because we've had a lot going on but we've managed to get into this really amazing rhythm. Just a really prolific patch of time. Are some of these songs held over from Californian Soil, or is it all brand new? Nothing is held over from Californian Soil - but there are a couple of songs that have been around in the ether for years and years and years, and we could just never get them right. You And I is one of them, and Into Gold is another one. Sometimes one of us will be going through our laptop and we'll find an old demo and think, What the hell is this? It's really good. So with those two songs, they are actually very old - just rewritten and reproduced.  I guess we just couldn't give them what they needed at the time. The curfew on the Park Stage is quite early  so will you dash off to watch the end of SZA or The Nationals sets? So, The National and SZA are two of my  favourite acts ever but I have a child now, so I might have to just go home and take care of him. But yeah, its funny for me, those two clashes. I'm going to be trying to focus on our own show, while seeing if I can like hear SZA and The National floating over on the breeze. You can just stop your show and sing along. Exactly. England is my favourite National song, so I could just harmonise along with them."
London bus drivers voting on strike action,"A ballot for industrial action opened this week and will close on 22 July. Unite regional officer Michelle Braveboy said: ""London United will be directly responsible for any disruption caused to bus services in South, West and Central London. ""There is still time to avoid strike action, but London United must table an offer our members can accept."" Unite said members refused the 4% increase as the retail price index (RPI) inflation rate was 5.1% when the pay increase was meant to be implemented in December 2023.

London council to ban leaving e-bikes on pavements,"Riders will be banned from abandoning e-bikes on busy town centre pavements in a south London borough under a new scheme. Wandsworth Council will bring the ban into force once it has finished installing 111 parking bays for e-bikes across the borough. The scheme aims to deal with issues created from when rental e-bikes are left parked on pavements, blocking routes for pedestrians. E-bike operator Forest said it  was ""thrilled to be formally partnering"" with the council, and Lime UK said the ""flexible parking rules help to avoid issues with pavement obstructions whilst ensuring shared e-bikes remain easy to use"". Installation of the parking bays - including Clapham Junction, Tooting Broadway, Tooting Bec, Wandsworth, Balham and Putney town centres - began on Thursday and the council expects to complete the works in about four weeks. The authority said e-bike parking will be banned on pavements in busy town centre locations once all the bays have been installed. It added ""free-floating"" parking will still be allowed away from these hotspots and in quieter parts of the borough, with more parking bays expected by the end of the year, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. David Tidley, head of transport strategy at the council, said the borough supports the use of e-bikes as a ""convenient travel option"" for residents and visitors, but they cause issues when parked inconsiderately. Asked by BBC London how the ""busy"" areas will be defined, the council said a zone has been agreed around the town centre bays which will be shown on the operators' apps, and a map will be uploaded to the council website showing the two different zones once the scheme is live. The council added operators will also use in-app messaging to explain the two zones in the borough and will show riders where the closest parking bay is. It follows a previous dispute between Wandsworth council and Lime. Council officers began seizing bikes in November 2022 after leader Simon Hogg said they had made Wandsworth town centre ""impassable"" one weekend. Similar issues have also been reported in other parts of London, including in Westminster, and in Hounslow where residents complained about an e-bike parking scheme trial. The National Federation of the Blind of the UK (NFBUK) had also said in 2022 many visually impaired people were unable to travel confidently and were put off visiting central London's attractions due to ""dangerous and awkward"" e-bikes dumped on pavements. Alex Berwin, head of policy at Forest, has said the company is ""thrilled to be formally partnering with Wandsworth Council"" for the scheme. ""This agreement will allow for the borough's residents, commuters and visitors to continue accessing our sustainable and affordable e-bike service, as well as provide safe and convenient spaces for e-bikes in the borough's high-footfall locations,"" he added. Hal Stevenson, director of policy at Lime, has said the firm is ""proud"" to work with the council on the ""flexible parking system"". He continued: ""It follows the recommendations from the recent Steer and Centre for London report; for less central boroughs to provide dedicated parking locations in busy areas and allow for non-obstructive parking - including at bike racks - elsewhere.""

Lucky draw sees six-year-old Swiftie bag tickets,"The record-breaking and globally renowned popstar will be bringing her hotly anticipated Eras tour to the Aviva Stadium for three sold-out nights beginning on Friday 28 June. Ms McDaid said when she missed out on tickets for the summer, she then went on a full-scale operation to try and source tickets, checking resale sites and ""entering any competition going"". I had everyone trying to get us tickets for it, we had a whole crowd of us online desperately looking, but had no luck whatsoever,"" she said. We were down to our last hope and we ended up entering this raffle as a bit of a last roll of the dice. I just put down for a random number, 34, and I was watching it live streamed in my work. I was shouting and screaming in work. ""I work in a Chinese restaurant, but I actually had to go outside because I just couldnt stop crying. She described some customers at the restaurant actually offering her money for the tickets there and then after hearing that she won them. Ms McDaid said telling her daughter the news over the phone, who was staying with her grandmother at the time was a moment of pure joy. Aria could hear me on the phone crying and actually asked me: What is wrong with mammy? I dont think she actually believed me when I told her. ""I still dont think she believes it  she probably wont believe it until shes there. Ms McDaid said Aria and her will be at the Aviva, proudly wearing their Taylor Swift friendship bracelets, belting out her hits.

M&S allowed to expand store in Swindon,"Marks & Spencer (M&S) has been given the go-ahead to expand its store at the Orbital Shopping Park in Swindon. The site, just off Thamesdown Drive in Priory Vale in north Swindon, will soon be expanded into the empty unit next door. The extension will increase its footprint by 40 per cent  to a total of nearly 60,000 square feet - and will feature a fresh market-style food hall and new clothing, home, and beauty departments. The company said the work is expected to be completed by spring 2025. The retail giant submitted planning applications to allow changes to the rear of the building to create a new, enclosed area for the plant running the buildings light and heating systems and changes to a trolley bay. The entrance lobby of the additional unit will be demolished and replaced with cladding to match the existing store and there will be new signs on the empty building. The company said, The proposed development will create a new, amalgamated retail unit for M&S which will allow an improved offering and better serving for the customer."" The report giving the chain store permission for the changes said the expansion would work well with the nature of the surrounding shopping centre and appearance of the wider area. The work can take place in stages so the branch will remain open as normal. There was sadness among shoppers in Swindon last year when M&S shut its town centre branch in Regent Street in late October. It had been trading from the site for 112 years and many residents worried its closure would negatively impact the town.

M&S website and app hit by technical issue,"Customers were unable to use Marks and Spencer's website and app for several hours on Saturday after it was hit by a technical issue. The website and app were back up and running by 18:15 BST. During the outage, users saw an error message on the homepage and could not navigate to any part of the website. An M&S spokeswoman told the BBC a problem with a third party provider had been ""temporarily affecting access"". The company added it was ""sorry to customers for the inconvenience caused"". Problems with access to the website and app were first reported on X, formerly Twitter, from around lunchtime on Saturday. The website came back online after 17:00 BST, only to go back to the original error message a short time later, but it was up and running again before 18:00 BST. The app was still showing a notice about a technical glitch for a short while after but is now operating normally. Its notice read: ""Sorry you can't shop through the app right now. ""We're busy making some planned changes, but will be back soon."" Some customers complained on social media that they had been unable to use their Sparks card - the company's loyalty scheme - as they did not have a physical card and claimed they had lost out on savings. In March, supermarket Sainsbury's was also hit with technical issues. It was unable to carry out most of its online grocery orders after an overnight update caused contactless payments to fail. nan nan nan"

MP Philip Dunne says bid to remove Boris Johnson not over,"Philip Dunne, who represents Ludlow, Shropshire, said the scale of Conservative opposition to Mr Johnson was ""not a situation that can endure"". He said he wanted a leadership contest to create the ""opportunity for integrity"" and for a new vision. Mr Dunne predicted more challenging months ahead for the prime minister, despite Mr Johnson describing his confidence vote win as ""decisive"". The Shropshire MP, who was first elected in 2005, said he would have preferred the no confidence vote to have taken place after the upcoming by-elections in Wakefield and in Tiverton and Honiton. He had not previously called for the prime minister to resign and explained: ""I hadn't wanted a vote to happen this time, because I thought he was likely to win it."" Under Conservative Party rules, 12 months must pass before another no confidence vote can be called. Speaking to BBC Radio Shropshire, Mr Dunne said: ""It's not going to happen for now, but we'll have to see in the coming weeks and months, I think this is not over."" Mentioning the state of the economy, the problems in Northern Ireland, the inquiry into whether he misled Parliament and the two by-elections, he said he thought Boris Johnson's situation would ""depend on events over the coming months"". He said the number of MPs voting against Mr Johnson had been ""at the upper end of my expectation"" and had ""surprised everybody"". ""I think the issue for many of my colleagues in Parliament is whether or not he remains a vote winner,"" he said. Mr Dunne also said it was not good for parties ""to have such things"", but added the Conservatives could recover before the next general election in 2024, if it can come together ""whether that's under the prime minister or somebody else"". In 2019 Mr Dunne supported Jeremy Hunt in his bid to become leader of the party. In response to Mr Dunne's comments, Boris Johnson supporter and Lichfield MP Michael Fabricant tweeted: ""The Ludlow MP, my friend Philip Dunne, led the Jeremy Hunt campaign for the leadership so THAT does not surprise me!""

MP sees Highley GP surgery closure as 'opportunity',"Highley Medical Practice, in Shropshire, was placed in special measures in January and the Ludlow MP Philip Dunne said the building in which it was based was too small. The current surgery provider has announced it wants to end its contract. Mr Dunne said he had ""long campaigned"" for an alternative set-up and approved of NHS plans to find a new provider. The current provider has agreed to keep the practice open until the end of March to allow time for a new surgery to be established. NHS Shropshire, Telford and Wrekin, which commissions GP services, said it was told on Tuesday of the operators' decision to pull out. Mr Dunne said he would help the NHS to find a ""sustainable long-term solution"". Mr Dunne, Conservative, said: ""In my view the current practice, housed in a former domestic setting, has limited opportunity to improve or expand services."" He said he had been asking the NHS to find an alternative for several years and, while he accepted change would be worrying for residents, added: ""This should provide a real opportunity to improve GP services for Highley residents."" Mr Dunne said he would push to make sure the new surgery was also in Highley. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Man had sexual images of children young as three,"Ms Wilks said police went to Lowden's home in April 2022 after being informed of the image on Discord. She said Lowden, of Leith Court, admitted having the images in his police interview. Ms Wilks said it had taken a long time for the case to reach court as there was an 18-month backlog in forensic digital policing services which had searched Lowden's computer and portable hard drive. As well as the 15 category A images, there were also 16 in category B and 33 in category C, with a further 15,593 ""uncharacterised images"", Ms Wilks said. She said the ages of children in the images ranged from three to 16 years old. Judge Nathan Adams said Lowden claimed he had been ""persuaded"" to download the images after meeting someone online, but denied having any sexual interest in children. The judge said Lowden's offending was still ""significantly concerning"" and needed to ""be addressed"", although he accepted the defendant had shown ""genuine remorse"" and a ""real understanding"" of the impact of his crime. ""Anyone who downloads images of this sort is supporting the horrific practice of those who create these videos,"" Judge Adams said. Lowden must also sign the sex offenders' register for five years and was made subject of a sexual harm prevention order strictly controlling his usage of the internet and internet-capable devices.

Man sentenced for dangerous work on home extension,"A man has been handed a suspended sentence for ""cost-cutting at the expense of safety"" by re-roofing his home without scaffolding, inspectors have said. Abdul Rehman began work on an extension to his two-storey house in Trafford, Greater Manchester in 2020, overseeing others working sometimes at night and without measures in place to stop them falling. He ignored repeated warnings by the Health and Safety Executive and was found guilty of breaching regulations. Rehman was handed a 12-month sentence, suspended for 18 months. He was also ordered to complete 180 hours of unpaid work and to pay £6,450 in legal costs at a hearing at Manchester Magistrates' Court. Rehman initially set up an unsafe scaffold when he started the work in 2020, but took it down after several enforcement notices were served. In November 2021, he restarted the work, overseeing several people who he had tasked with re-roofing the home. HSE inspector Phil Redman said it was ""fortunate nobody was seriously injured or killed"" by Rehman's ""serious breach"" of health and safety rules. A fixed scaffold should have been put up around the home, but Rehman chose to ""put cost cutting at the expensive of safety"", he added.

Man shot dead by police in a second in raid - court,"Speaking at an event in January to mark the fifth anniversary of Mr Fitzgerald's death, his partner Sharlene Whetstone said they had been ""left in the dark for five years"". ""We can't even grieve yet, how can we grieve when they're just saying, 'He's gone and no-one is saying why'."" In January, it emerged Officer K would not be prosecuted after shooting Mr Fitzgerald. The case has been examined by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), following a mandatory referral from the West Midlands Police (WMP) force. No weapons were recovered from the home, the opening of Mr Fitzgerald's inquest heard. West Midlands Police is now applying for anonymity for a total of 22 employees, 11 of whom are specialist firearms officers, while West Mercia Police is applying for two employees to remain anonymous, described as senior intelligence officers. Lawyers representing the forces argued Officer K and others should receive anonymity for safety reasons, as they could come into contact with serious organised gang members in the future. They also put forward arguments against Officer K appearing in court in front of the victims family, including his brother, Liam Fitzgerald. The lawyers argued they themselves would be at risk of being pressured by criminal gangs into revealing Officer Ks identity. However, the lawyer representing Sean Fitzgeralds family said it was important that the police were held to account and that this was a powerful imperative for open justice . He added Mr Fitzgerald's family should be able to see Officer K and other officers involved and that, allowing 24 officers to come and go behind screens would undermine public confidence. Another hearing to decide the final terms and scope of the inquest will be held in the autumn, a date for that has yet to be set but it is likely Mr Fitzgeralds family will have to wait until next spring for the full inquest to start.

Man who helped revolutionise rain-hit cricket dies aged 84,"The former King Edward VII School Lytham student and University of Liverpool graduate spent his entire career working in the nuclear industry. Originally employed as a metallurgist, he found he had an ability to extract useful information from masses of numerical measurements. A course in statistics followed and he later became a statistician, being elected as a fellow of the Royal Statistical Society in 1974. At the society's conference in 1992, he presented a short paper which proposed a formula for target correction in rain interrupted one-day cricket matches. This led him to meet Lewis, a mathematics lecturer, who suggested an analysis of one-day score sheets based on Duckworth's proposed formula. Their method was devised in the wake of a farcical Cricket World Cup semi-final between England and South Africa in 1992. Rain stopped play with South Africa needing 22 runs from 13 balls, but on resumption, the then-method of recalculation, which was based on productive overs, saw them requiring an almost impossible 22 runs off one delivery. Speaking in 2007, Duckworth, who lived in Gloucestershire,  said he recalled hearing BBC Test Match Special commentator Christopher Martin-Jenkins ""on the radio, saying 'surely someone, somewhere, could come up with something better'"". ""I realised that it was a mathematical problem that required a mathematical solution,"" he said. The subsequent Duckworth-Lewis method involves calculating how many runs a team needs to score, proportionally taking into account the overs left and wickets remaining - whereas previous methods just based the solution on runs and overs remaining. The method was first used in the ICC Trophy in Malaysia in 1997 and in 1998, it was applied in New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, India and West Indies. The International Cricket Council adopted the method for the 1999 World Cup in England and it was adopted on a trial basis for all cricket by the ICC in 2001 before becoming the permanent solution three years later. It is now known as the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method after Australian statistician Prof Steven Stern became the custodian of the method following his predecessors' retirement. Stern updated the method in 2014 to take into account modern scoring trends and T20 cricket. The method was used as recently as Monday in the rain-affected World Cup match between Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Duckworth received an honorary doctorate from the University of Bath in 2015. In the citation, it said he had been as important to the nuclear industry as he had been to cricket. ""He came to realise the importance of statistics, not just to ensure reactor safety but also to assure the public that the reactors are safe,"" it said. ""At that time, there were no statisticians working at the laboratories, so he set about making himself into a statistician. ""Then he had to convince his colleagues and others of the power of statistics, and spreading that idea has been at the core of everything he has done since. ""Persuading the cricket administrators that statistics could help them was just another example of that."" Mr Eastaway said while the statistician had been a powerhouse when it came to numbers, he also had a lighter side. ""When Tony Lewis died in 2020, he phoned to tell me that people thought he was already dead,"" he said. ""They were like a comedy double act. ""Lewis was the straight man and Frank was very jovial."" Mr Duckworth leaves a widow, who he married in 1969, a daughter and two grandsons.

You can also send story ideas to northwest.newsonline@bbc.co.uk Frank Duckworth, the man whose mathematical knowledge helped to revolutionise rain-affected cricket, has died aged 84. The Lytham-born statistician created the Duckworth-Lewis method, a model to recalculate scores when limited-over matches were curtailed by weather conditions, with fellow Lancastrian Tony Lewis. Announcing Duckworth's death, fellow statistician Rob Eastaway said he had been ""a very genial man"" who was ""proud"" of the method, despite it leaving casual fans somewhat flummoxed. ""A lot of people either claim they don't understand it or don't like it, but they know deep down, it is the best way of working,"" he said. The former King Edward VII School Lytham student and University of Liverpool graduate spent his entire career working in the nuclear industry. Originally employed as a metallurgist, he found he had an ability to extract useful information from masses of numerical measurements. A course in statistics followed and he later became a statistician, being elected as a fellow of the Royal Statistical Society in 1974. At the society's conference in 1992, he presented a short paper which proposed a formula for target correction in rain interrupted one-day cricket matches. This led him to meet Lewis, a mathematics lecturer, who suggested an analysis of one-day score sheets based on Duckworth's proposed formula. Their method was devised in the wake of a farcical Cricket World Cup semi-final between England and South Africa in 1992. Rain stopped play with South Africa needing 22 runs from 13 balls, but on resumption, the then-method of recalculation, which was based on productive overs, saw them requiring an almost impossible 22 runs off one delivery.

Man's 123 peak charity climb in memory of airmen,"""They decided to remain with their plane and deliberately ditch it in to a cricket pitch, rather than bail out and risk the plane crashing into a densely populated residential area,"" he said. Sgt John Collingham, aircraftman Sydney Firth and pilot officer James Irvine were all killed. ""To make that split-second decision to sacrifice yourself and save other people I thought was a really profound thing and it really impacted me quite a lot,"" said Mr Mulvaney. ""And I just wanted to do something that would help me and give me an excuse to talk about them and to share their story."" He has now completed more than 100 peaks in the UK as well as travelling to Morocco to scale Mount Toubkal. ""Travelling to Morocco with a medallion I had inscribed with the names of the airmen was a highlight for me,"" he said. ""I figured stashing it at the top of a tall mountain would be a fitting tribute to their sacrifice and a way to say thanks for encouraging me to become a better person,"" he said. ""The sacrifice of these three people 84 years ago inspired me to change my life - perhaps inspiration is all around us, we just have to open our eyes, listen and seize the opportunity.""

Man's bid to save lives after twin brother's death,"He was my best friend and my twin brother  he was just me in a different body, Mr Baker-Osborne said. Thirty family members had travelled to Poole for a five-day caravan holiday by the sea when the tragedy occurred. The children were playing and paddling in water at about knee-depth when the rip current knocked them off their feet. Mr Baker-Osborne, described as a hero during an inquest into his death, was believed to have helped save three or four children before becoming submerged. His body was found four days later during a search led by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). Ryan Baker-Osborne said he now visited schools to talk to young people about the dangers of swimming in open water, particularly during the summer months. He said his aim was to help save peoples lives so that families would not go through what they did. When youre caught in water, just float  head back, ears in the water, arms and legs out. Dont panic, he said. Personally, I wont just go and jump into any lake or any river. I say go to the water parks or places like that where theyve got lifeguards watching. A family day is due to be held in July at Pinley Rugby Club in Coventry on the third anniversary of Mr Baker-Osbornes death, which is aiming to raise money for the RNLI.

Manchester hospital delays 'contributed to boy's death' inquest hears,"Joel Rawlinson was admitted to North Manchester General Hospital on 29 December 2019 after he collapsed. The 12-year-old had had heart surgery two weeks after he was born but lived a normal life since then. The ""biggest issue"" was failing to recognise how unwell Joel was, the inquest heard. Coroner Paul Appleton heard evidence about the case at Manchester Coroner's Court on Monday. Consultant paediatrician Dr Graham Mason, who reviewed the care given to Joel, told the court that on the balance of probability the boy, who had collapsed at his home in Middleton, would have survived if the failings had not happened. He said there was a ""failure to recognise the seriousness of (Joel's) illness and escalate appropriately"" adding ""crucially that is the biggest issue"". Manchester Coroner's Court also heard there was a delay in the attendance of a consultant in person and subsequent delays in transferring Joel to Manchester Children's Hospital. He died the next day at Alder Hey Children's hospital in Liverpool. He had been transferred there after doctors at Manchester Children's Hospital recognised he had suffered a ruptured aorta, leading to cardiorespiratory failure. Dr Mason added there was a ""significant amount of focus around a potential diagnosis rather than recognising how severely unwell he was"". Mr Appleton was also told on Monday that Joel's blood pressure was low and not responding to efforts to increase it. Dr Mason said there should have been further escalation at this point as ""low blood pressure can reflect serious illness in Joel's case we now know there was a rupture to the right atrium"". When asked by coroner, Paul Appleton, about the impacts of the delays during Joel's care, Dr Mason said: ""On balance of probabilities he would have survived if all of the steps had been taken more quickly.""

Maritime Festival shows 'the city has changed for the better',"The festival programme has included live performances, DJ sessions, watersport taster events, the Legenderry Food Village, a Carnival of Colours and vintage funfair, as well as boat viewings and ship tours. There have been tall ships berthed along the quay while a pirate's pontoon is in place to entertain children during the four-day festival run. The festival also includes a first look at the city's planned DNA Museum, which is due to open in 2026. Paula McCallion, who was there with her grandson Fionn, said the festival was an opportunity for the city to come together. ""It's been fantastic to see the crowds again in Derry,"" she said. ""The buzz about it - it's been fantastic."" She and her family watched a fireworks display on the riverfront on Saturday night and a light show that saw the tall ships sail along the river to music. ""It was just fantastic to see the lights going up and down the Foyle,"" she said. ""It was great for everybody just to be out and about - even though it got a bit wet!"" The festivals flagship finale  Beyond Blue  took place on Saturday night. During the showcase, the tall ships were illuminated by Visual Spectrum Studio. This was followed by a choreographed lights show and a fireworks display. The Clipper Round the World Yacht Race has been a key feature of the Foyle Maritime Festival over the years, including in 2022. However, Derry did not play host to the festival this year. ""The city needs it,"" said Colm Quigley. ""We need more things like this. Any other city that has a waterfront like this, they would be utilising it. It's only good for the city."" He and Sophie Curran were among those on Sunday soaking up the final of the four-day Foyle Maritime Festival. ""Oh it's brilliant, I'm really happy to have it back,"" said Sophie of the event, which was last held in 2022. Thousands of people are in Londonderry this weekend for a celebration of the citys seafaring heritage. The Foyle Maritime Festival, which got under way on Thursday along the city's riverfront, runs until Sunday evening. Lindsay Nelis and her family visited from Bangor in County Down. Lindsay, whose husband is originally from Derry, said she couldn't believe how much the city had changed for the better over the years. ""We're having a lovely time, walking along, and just soaking up the atmostphere,"" she said. Derry City and Strabane District Council's head of culture, Aeidin McCarter, said the festival, last held in 2022, is one of the biggest events in Derry's calendar and has become a huge economic driver for the region. The festival programme has included live performances, DJ sessions, watersport taster events, the Legenderry Food Village, a Carnival of Colours and vintage funfair, as well as boat viewings and ship tours.

Mark Pritchard: Outside jobs and expensed visits eclipse Wrekin MP's salary,"The Conservative earned £74,066 from six consultancy roles in 2022. He also took five foreign trips with expenses worth £14,666, racking up £88,733 in payments and perks in all, the Commons register of interests shows. The basic annual salary for an MP is £84,144, as of April 2022. Mr Pritchard has been contacted for comment. A BBC Radio Shropshire investigation found his outside jobs took up time worth about 41 working days last year, on top of 20 days abroad, adding up to the equivalent of 61 working days. Backbenchers are allowed to have second jobs outside Westminster - in 2021 almost a third of MPs declared extra earnings ranging from £50 a year to almost £1m. Like other MPs, Mr Pritchard publicly declared his outside earnings in the House of Commons register of interests, setting out how he spent an average 49 hours per month providing marketing advice to five companies in 2022. Anneliese Dodds, Labour Party Chair, said her party tried to ban second jobs in 2021, but Conservative MPs voted for ""a watered down cop-out"". Mr Pritchard declared five foreign visits last year, spending a total of 20 days abroad, on trips that were paid by donors and that he said were worth just over £14,600. Four of those trips appear to have been taken when the House of Commons was sitting, although whether or not parliamentary time was properly used is not known and there is no suggestion of any wrongdoing. However, James Roberts, managing director of lobby group Taxpayers' Alliance, which campaigns to cut tax and spending, suggested local voters should have a right to recall ""if they decide their MP isn't properly discharging their duties"". ""Politicians working outside the Westminster bubble brings many benefits, but constituents come first,"" he said. ""Those doing part-time jobs during parliamentary time should be able to justify this to the people they represent."" Labour chair Anneliese Dodds said: ""If Rishi Sunak is to ever honour his promise of honesty, integrity and accountability, and extract his party from this constant quagmire of sleaze he needs to deal with the issue of moonlighting MPs once and for all. ""There is no reason why a serving constituency MP needs to make thousands and thousands of pounds as consultants. It's bad for their constituents and damages public trust in politicians."" A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: ""Integrity, professionalism and accountability are core values of this government. ""An MP's primary job is and must be to serve their constituents and represent their interests in Parliament. ""The government has already banned unwarranted paid-for advocacy and is working closely with the Standards Committee to ensure that MPs focus on their constituents."" Westminster's Standards Committee is conducting an ongoing inquiry into All Party Parliamentary Groups (APPGs), which are linked to foreign trips, and new limits on outside work are also being considered. Fellow Shropshire Conservative MPs Daniel Kawczynski and Philip Dunne also topped up their salaries with outside earnings worth nearly half their basic pay in 2022. Mr Kawczynski earned £36,000 from consultancy work for mining company the Electrum Group LLC, which paid him £3,000 a month for 15 hours work. He also took up two foreign trips, which he declared to have been worth £4,244 in expenses for hotels, travel and meals. An eight-day trip to Poland in July, valued at £4,052, was sponsored by the Polish National Foundation with the aim of strengthening bilateral relations. A second, three-day trip to Albania was sponsored by civil engineers Elysium Construction Ltd ""to advance economic and cultural ties"" and included accommodation worth £192. The Albanian visit appears to have been taken when the Commons was sitting, although again there is no suggestion of impropriety. Mr Kawczynski's outside job took up about 24 working days last year, on top of 13 days abroad, totalling the equivalent of 37 working days. It is not known whether this overlapped with parliamentary time. Philip Dunne, who is the chair of Westminster's environmental audit committee, has two outside jobs worth £42,081 and spent the equivalent of about 19 working days on these roles last year. He is a non-executive director of engineering technology developer Reaction Engines Ltd, based in Oxfordshire. He was paid £3,400 a month for eight hours work, totalling £40,800 a year. Mr Dunne is also a partner in Leominster-based Gatley Farms, drawing down £1,281 for 50 hours of work over the year. He did not make any foreign visits. ""I do outside work that is related and unrelated to my work as an MP and which broadens my understanding of the world around us,"" Mr Dunne said. ""I'm perfectly confident that I can do that and serve my constituents as a hard-working MP."" Frontbench MPs were expected to carry out ministerial work alongside their constituency duties, he added. Mr Dunne also said he was proud to carry out voluntary roles, including as Commissioner on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. Telford MP Lucy Allan (Conservative) and North Shropshire MP Helen Morgan (Liberal Democrats) declared no outside earnings or foreign trips. Ms Morgan said: ""Being an MP is a privilege and, for me, involves working full time to represent my constituents. ""My only focus is on representing North Shropshire and doing everything possible to improve the lives of the people who live here. All MPs were contacted for comment.

"Market fined £75,000 after escaped cow killed man","The operators of a cattle market have been ordered to pay more than £82,000 in fines and costs for health and safety failings after an escaped cow killed a 75-year-old man. Huw Evans died in hospital from multiple injuries six days after being trampled by the animal that escaped from Whitland livestock market in Carmarthenshire in November 2022. David Arwel Thomas of JJ Morris Limited, which operates the mart, had previously pleaded guilty to failing in its health, safety and welfare duty to an employee, and failing in the firms duty to the safety of the wider public. Co-director John Nicholas was also at Llanelli Magistrates Court and the pair were ordered to pay fines of £75,000, with £5,047 costs and a £2,000 surcharge. Anthony Vines, for the Health and Safety Executive, said there were no physical measures at the mart to prevent a cow escaping. Mr Vines said guidance from the livestock auctioneers association suggested all livestock markets should have cattle grids or fencing. The firm had employed a risk management consultant in February 2022, before the incident, but no feedback had been provided on the recommendations until after 29 November 2022. A cattle grid and fencing have been installed at the mart since the fatal incident which cost between £60,000-£70,000. The cow, owned by Paula Wilson, was eventually shot by police. The nine-year-old red Limousin cross breed escaped from the mart while being unloaded from a trailer. Alun Williams, for the firm, said the cow should not have been delivered to the mart as it was in an extremely agitated state and was aggressive"". He said the company had been in operation for many years and took their obligation to the local community seriously"". He said both the directors wanted to express their condolences and sympathy to Mr Evans's family. He said the company, founded in the 1950s, employed more than 60 people, with 35 employed at the Whitland site. This was the first reported accident since the mart at Whitland was taken over by JJ Morris in 1992, although a cow had escaped into a nearby recycling site at the end of 2021 before being safely captured. Mr Williams said the firm had dealt with a million head of cattle during the operation of the Whitland mart. The site is owned by a local farmers' cooperative and leased to JJ Morris. He said the firm had embarked on a journey to improve procedures since the death, there had been improved training and investment in the site, and the company accepted full responsibility for what had happened. Mr Evans, a retired council worker, was crossing the road when he was attacked by the cow. The court heard that multiple members of mart staff had tried to stop and control the cow. The cow struck one employee, who suffered injuries to his leg, before making its way outside and hitting Mr Evans near the Co-op store. Mr Evans was airlifted to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and died six days later of multiple serious injuries. In a statement after his death, he was described by his family as a ""loved Dad, Dad-cu, brother, uncle and friend to many."" In a victim impact statement read to the court by Mr Vines, his son Dafydd John Evans said he has lost his best friend and that he missed him terribly. He added that he had been taken too soon. The court heard that many local people who knew him had lined the route for his funeral. His family were in court for the sentencing. HSE inspector Rhys Hughes said in a statement: ""This tragic incident was foreseeable and preventable. ""The risk posed by cattle escaping from the livestock mart should have been identified, and effective control measures implemented. ""The case highlights the importance of following industry guidance, which is readily accessible and outlines the requirements to safely manage cattle."""

Masterpiece hidden in mine in WW2 returns to Wales,"More than 80 years later it is back and will be on display at the library until September. The exhibition tells the story of The Stonemasons Yard and how it came to Wales as a ""refugee"" from bombing to be safely protected in the cavernous Manod slate mines. Winston Churchill  prime minister during the war - ordered the National Gallery's collection to be moved away from London and hidden in ""caves and cellars"". Brick studios and air conditioning were installed inside the mines to store the National Gallerys collection which included work by artists such as Titian, Michelangelo and Constable. Long after the paintings had been returned to London, Glyn Williams and his family from Blaenau Ffestiniog became the owners of the quarry. In the 1980s, Mr Williams said he had plans to expand the work there but the UK government wanted to keep the warehouses in place and restricted blasting at the quarry in case the warehouses were damaged. Mr Williams won a court victory to effectively evict the government and expanded quarrying at Manod. In 1983 he helped produce a booklet to remember the time the priceless works of art were stored in the quarry. He said transporting some of the paintings proved difficult  a portrait of Charles I on horseback by Van Dyck - was 3.67m (12ft) tall and 2.92m (9ft 7in) wide. Also, a trench had to be dug under a railway bridge in Llan Ffestiniog as the gap was not big enough for the lorry transporting the artwork. Mr Williams said: ""But they still miscalculated by about two inches, so they had to let all the air out of the tyres to get under the bridge and then pump them up again to go up to the quarry."" He said the paintings were well looked after  experts stayed near the quarry to care for them and a garrison of soldiers guarded them - while air conditioning units kept the air ""quite clean and static"" to protect them. After the war ended, the 2,000 works were returned to their galleries, many to the National Gallery some to Buckingham Palace. As part of the National Gallerys 200th anniversary celebrations, 12 masterpieces from its collection are on display across the UK. The exhibition in Aberystwyth is the only one in Wales and, for the first time at the national library, there will be an audio described tour for some of the items for visitors who are blind or visually-impaired. Rhodri Llwyd Morgan, chief executive of the National Library of Wales, said it was ""an honour to have one of Canaletto's masterpieces here"". Canaletto was born in 1697 and raised in Venice. and was the city's most famous Venetian painter of his day. The Stonemasons Yard is one of his early paintings and is different from many of his other work as it depicts a scene of daily life rather than his celebrated views of Venices Grand Canal, regattas and festival days."

Mr McGrath is being replaced as finance minister in the coalition government by Jack Chambers. Mr Chambers, who was first elected to the Dáil (lower house of Irish parliament) in 2016 was most recently a minister of state at the Department of Transport. Mr Chambers will shortly present a summer economic statement which sets the parameters for a pre-election budget. The general election must take place before the end of March, but could be called earlier after the coalition parties had a better-than-expected showing in recent local and European elections. Mr McGrath was appointed as finance minister in December 2022 having previously served as minister for public expenditure. One of Mr McGrath's major achievements has been to establish a sovereign wealth fund, which will invest some of Irelands corporation tax windfall. The European Commission is the European Unions executive body which is overseen by 27 commissioners nominated by the member states. Irelands previous commissioner was Mairead McGuinness who held the financial services portfolio. The Irish government will be pushing for Mr McGrath to get an economics-focused portfolio."

Middleham housing plans near 12th Century castle spark concerns,"An application to build 55 homes in Middleham has been submitted to North Yorkshire Council, but Historic England warned it was a ""sensitive location"". Other objectors said modern housing could spoil the historic landscape, including the Norman Middleham Castle. However, developers said the plans would have ""no adverse impact"". According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS), the housing development was proposed for an area west of St Akelda's Road in Middleham. Papers submitted to the council underlined how the proposed development was first unveiled more than a decade ago and was granted in 2021, only for access issues to hinder the venture, leading to the consent lapsing. The documents stated the main impacts of the development would be upon the setting of the Middleham conservation area, the 12th Century Grade I-listed and scheduled monument Middleham Castle and Grade I-listed Church of St Mary and St Alkelda. In the documents, the agents for the developers said: ""While a number of minor impacts are identified, primarily relating to longer distance views from the north of the site...the heritage assessment advises these are capable of mitigation."" Responding to the proposal, Historic England said it continued to have concerns on heritage grounds owing to the application not including all the proposed details of the housing estate. A spokesperson for the organisation said: ""There should be a clear delivery mechanism and comprehensive assurances between what might be proposed in an outline application and what might be built in this sensitive location."" Meanwhile, Richmond Civic Society said it objected to the application on the grounds it ""involves a significant loss of landscape value in relation to the very substantial historic interest of the Norman castle"". Other objectors have claimed a development on the proposed site would significantly alter the view seen by visitors arriving at the historic town from Leyburn, and that buildings to the rear of the development would make ""the modern development the dominant feature in the landscape"". In a letter to the authority, one objector wrote: ""It is not acceptable that the introduction of a sizeable development of modern housing is allowed to be inserted into the heart of an historic setting that will fundamentally change how the castle and the bridge sit in the landscape, and thus alter the character of Wensleydale."" But the developers' agents said the site could be developed for residential purposes ""without harm to the landscape qualities of the area"". Their application added: ""The development would sit well on the site without adverse impact on the local landscape. ""It would have no adverse impact on significant views and vistas or impact on significant characteristics of the local landscape.""

Missing 6th Century bucket pieces found at Sutton Hoo,"The National Trust, about 80 volunteers from across the world, FAS Heritage and Channel 4's Time Team started excavations at the beginning of June. It was part of a two-year research project exploring the earlier history of Sutton Hoo, famous for the discovery of an Anglo Saxon burial ship in 1939 that has been described as one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of all time. Angus Wainwright, regional archaeologist for the charity, said earlier surveys by Time Team identified some ""mysterious anomalies"" which led to the excavation of Garden Field. ""Because of its proximity to fragments discovered much earlier, we had hoped this years dig would yield more of the Bromeswell Bucket,"" he said. ""[It] originated from the Byzantine Empire in the 6th Century - around a hundred years before the ship and its extraordinary treasure was put to rest."" Using specialist technology, he said the group was able to confirm fragments already held in the collection were part of the same artefact. On closer inspection ""we believe that the bucket had been previously damaged and then repaired"" and some parts ""soldered back together"", he added. The entirety of Garden Field has been metal detected, with recovered items recorded in 3D. These will be sent away for processing and cataloguing before being returned to Sutton Hoo at a later date. Tim Taylor, Time Teams series producer and creator, said it had been ""fantastic"". ""Weve experimented with some new technology and perspectives, including the use of a live 360-camera and first person 'specs cam', which has really brought our fans closer to the action.""

Moldova takes difficult step on path to joining EU,"For Moldova as much as Ukraine, Tuesday 25 June will be a momentous day, when the European Union embarks on years of talks aimed at bringing in the two countries as new members. Moldovan President Maia Sandu, a prime mover in the European direction, has set 2030 as a target to join the EU, but her country faces a long and arduous journey towards membership. Chisinau has the feel of a European city. Young musicians sing Whitney Houston's ""I wanna dance with somebody"" outside a trendy restaurant as Moldovans pass by. But the city's buildings remind you of its Tsarist, Romanian and Soviet past as much as its vibrant present. Moldova's population of 2.6 million is tiny in European terms, and one in five people live in the capital. But Maia Sandu has a high standing among EU leaders, not least for her fluency in English and French. She travels to EU summits in economy class and dresses in jeans and trainers. You would be hard-pressed to find anyone who does not believe their move towards the EU is linked to the war in neighbouring Ukraine. One of Europe's poorest countries, Moldova sits between Ukraine and Romania. It is plagued by corruption and gets by largely from remittances sent by its large diaspora across the EU. And that link with the rest of Europe is significant, notwithstanding Russia's efforts to discredit it. When President Sandu signed a decree last week on EU accession talks, she spoke of Moldova becoming part of a ""stronger, united Europe"". But the Kremlin pointed out that while Moldova was a sovereign state, its ""future interests"" should also be linked to Russian markets and the ""integration processes"" of former Soviet territory. Despite its Romanian-speaking majority, Moldova is a former Soviet republic and much of its eastern fringe is home to a pro-Moscow breakaway region called Transnistria. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, within days Kyiv closed the 452km (280-mile) border it shares with Transnistria. Russian troops have never left since the disintegration of the USSR, and the region is a reminder of Moscows long arm in its former republics. As she signed last week's decree, President Sandu will have had half an eye on two big votes in October. Not only does she aim to be re-elected in presidential elections, but a referendum is taking place on enshrining their countrys path to EU membership in the constitution. Her country is divided into pro and anti-EU camps and its biggest obstacle is  Transnistria. This problem cannot be sorted overnight, admits pro-government MP, Oazu Nantoi, but now that the Ukrainian border is closed, he is optimistic. We have leverage to put pressure on this separatist regime,"" he told the BBC. ""Joint Moldovan-Ukrainian customs controls are carried out at the Cuciurgan border crossing point, so Transnistria has become an enclave."" Before it joins the EU, Moldova will have to sign up to broad democratic and judicial guarantees, and Valeriu Renita, an opposition journalist from pro-Russian party Sansa (The Chance), says Chisinau is failing to do that. ""The government has closed 13 TV networks, 30 websites, judicial reform is going badly - some would say the country is a dictatorship, he told the BBC. His party was banned from running in local elections last November, and Mr Renita denies the allegation that Moldovas opposition is following orders from Moscow. At the heart of Russia's alleged bid to destabilise Moldova lies one man: fugitive business magnate Ilan Shor who was convicted in absentia five years ago for embezzling $1bn from Moldovan banks. Shor, who now has Russian as well as Israeli citizenship, now works out of Moscow as informal coordinator of anti-EU and pro-Russia forces in Moldova. Those pro-Russian groups held a congress in Moscow recently and when some of the participants returned to Chisinau, the authorities confiscated more than 1m in cash. Moldova timeline 1812 Eastern part of Principality of Moldova annexed by Tsarist Russia and renamed Bessarabia 1918 As Tsarist Russia crumbles, Bessarabia becomes part of Kingdom of Romania 1940 After Stalin ultimatum, Romania cedes Bessarabia to USSR. It is then combined with Transnistria to form the Soviet Socialist Republic of Moldavia 1991-92 Moldavia declares independence from the Soviet Union. After a brief civil war, Transnistrian separatists supported by the Soviet army are stationed on the east bank of the River Nistru Language is the main dividing line here. Romanian/Moldovan speakers, who represent about 80% of Moldovas 2.6 million residents, not including Transnistria, are strongly in favour of EU integration. Ethnic minorities, who include Russians, Ukrainians, Bulgarians and Gagauz, and speak mainly Russian are against. Moldova's government says many of them have been heavily influenced by Russia's information war. The Gagauz, who are a Turkic Christian ethnic group in an autonomous southern region of Moldova, are led by a pro-Kremlin governor called Evgenia Gutul. She is a known supporter of Ilan Shor and earlier this year Moldova's EU ambassador Janis Mazeiks complained it was impossible to have a dialogue with her. Domestically, opinion polls put support for the EU in the 20 October referendum at 55-65%. But factor in the hundreds of thousands of Moldovans who live and work in the European Union, then a Yes-vote seems assured, for the moment at least. With their votes Maia Sandu could even with outright victory in the first round of the presidential election. But Russia's influence is ever-present, whether in the war in neighbouring Ukraine or in the fake news that appears on TikTok or Telegram. So much so that the government in Chisinau fears Moscow may try to foment violence in the run-up to October's referendum. President Sandu has already been targeted in a deep-fake video while another fake has featured a military camp for Moldovan children. Galina Vasilieva, who edits Romanian and Russian-language news website NewsMaker, says these are seen by Moldovans who are most susceptible to propaganda. ""In the 2016 presidential elections there was a fake clip claiming Maia Sandu had agreed with EU leaders to accept Syrian refugees. Many believed it, and she lost the election."""
More flights cancelled as Aer Lingus dispute continues,"Irish broadcaster RTÉ had reported that the recommendation for an additional strike was made by IALPA on Thursday. However, on Friday afternoon, Capt Mark Tighe, president of the union, said that Ireland's Labour Court has invited both parties in the dispute to return to them on Monday afternoon. ""We are in the process of discussing that and that of course would have relevance to whether or not we escalate the industrial action,"" he told Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""Im hoping now that they have noted the seriousness of the situation and that theyll be able to apply their considerable expertise."" Talks between it and Aer Lingus to resolve the ongoing pay dispute broke down without a resolution on Thursday. A group of students and teachers from Shimna Integrated School in County Down who were retuning from a trip to Berlin had their flight home cancelled while they were in the airport. Teacher Luke McWatters, said that their 21:45 flight on Thursday was initially showing as delayed and then, more than two hours after the flight was initially due to take off, they were told it was cancelled. Trying to ring through to Aer Lingus I was on three different calls to three different agents who, every time I got to a certain way through said: Because youre a group we cant do anything for you -you have to contact group Aer Lingus who dont open until 9am. Mr McWatters told the BBCs Evening Extra programme that he felt they had been left high and dry, with no offer of accommodation or food. He said the group slept on the airport floor. Mr McWatters said they were offered an alternative flight on 1 July. At that stage we made the call to try other airlines and split ourselves up as a group, he added. Half of the group travelled to Edinburgh, while the other half caught a flight to Poland, with both groups booked on flights back to Ireland on Friday. Mr McWatters said that the support for Aer Lingus had fallen very short of what you would expect from a major airline dealing with children. The BBC has contacted Aer Lingus for a response.

""We dont believe anybody should be getting less than inflation, but yesterday in an effort to resolve this, we said we would accept less than inflation."" However, he added: ""We believe inflation is a very reasonable claim in this current time."" IALPA had recommended to trade union Fórsa that the additional strike should be longer than the action planned for Saturday, RTÉ has reported. If sanctioned, Fórsa will have to give seven days notice to Aer Lingus before pilots can stop work. Aer Lingus has described the potential of further strike action as ""entirely inappropriate given the request of the Labour Court this week that the dispute should not be escalated"". Donal Moriarty, Aer Lingus' chief corporate affairs officer, said the airline is ""willing to go back to the Labour Court on a formal joint referral basis"".

More than £1m paid in fines for bus gate misuse,"More than £1m has been added to a council's coffers in fines paid by drivers flouting bus gate rules in a city. There are six bus gates in the centre of Cambridge, with the one on Silver Street being the most ignored or misunderstood by motorists. It brought in more than £370,000 in fines last year. The gates restrict access to private cars while allowing buses, emergency vehicles, cyclists and taxis to use the routes. They are operated by the county council, which said the money it collected would fund road maintenance. There are bus gates on Regent Street, Emmanuel Road, Bridge Street, Station Road, Silver Street and Worts Causeway. A Freedom of Information request by the Local Democracy Reporting Service found that last year most fines were issued to drivers breaching the restrictions on Silver Street, with £370,570.57 being collected in total  £173,838 from the inbound bus gate and £196,732.57 from the outbound gate. The lowest amount of fines were collected from the Worts Causeway bus gate, with £23,883.13 in paid penalties. This gate is the only one in the city that currently does not restrict access 24 hours a day. Restrictions are only in place between 07:30 and 09:30 on Monday to Friday, to give priority to buses in the morning. The total collected in fines last year was less than the previous two years, when the authority collected more than £1.5m each year. A spokesperson for Cambridgeshire County Council said: ""Bus lanes are enforced to help keep bus journeys reliable, encourage more sustainable ways of travelling and keep traffic moving on the roads. ""We would like to remind drivers to observe all road signs while travelling and take note of the restrictions. ""Any money collected from bus gate fines is reserved for spending on highways projects and road maintenance schemes."" Follow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

More wounded Palestinians tell BBC the Israeli army forced them onto jeep,"When they turned him over and found that he was alive, he was beaten with a gun, he says, before being picked up, carried to the jeep and thrown onto it. They took off my [trousers]. I wanted to hold onto the car, but [one soldier] hit my face and told me not to. Then he started driving, he said. I was waiting for death. Samir showed us video footage from a security camera which appears to show him semi-naked, lying on a fast-moving jeep with a number 1 clearly marked on its side. The location seems to match where the operation took place, but there is no date or time visible on the recording. Another Palestinian man, Hesham Isleit, also told the BBC he was shot twice during the operation in Jabariyat and forced onto the same military jeep, marked with the number 1. He described shooting from all sides and said he tried to run away but was shot in the leg, after which an army unit arrived to collect him and another man. They ordered us to stand up, and undressed us, he said, then they asked us to get onto the front of the jeep. The car was so hot, it felt like fire, he says. I was barefoot and undressed. I tried to put my hand on the jeep and I couldnt, it was burning hot. I was telling them it was very hot, and they were forcing me to get on  telling me that if I didnt want to die, I should do it. We put these allegations to Israels army; it said the cases were under review. In response to the original video of Mujahid Abadi Balas last week, the Israeli army said that he was tied to the jeep in a violation of orders and procedures and that his case would be investigated. The conduct of the forces in the video of the incident does not conform to the values of the IDF, it said in a written response. From his hospital bed, Mujahid told the BBC he hadnt expected to survive the experience, and was saying his final prayers as he lay on the moving vehicle. He showed the BBC a second video, recorded at some distance, that appears to support his account of being thrown onto the vehicle by Israeli soldiers. Once they confirmed that I had nothing on me [no weapon], they came down from the jeep and started beating me on the face, the head, and the sites of my injuries, he said. The soldiers picked me up by my wrists and ankles, and [swung me] right and left, before throwing me in the air. He says he fell to the ground, was picked up and swung again, before being thrown onto the jeep, and driven to a nearby house. The army said it was in Jabariyat last weekend to arrest wanted suspects, and that during the operation terrorists opened fire at troops, who responded with live fire. Hesham said the house that he and Mujahid were in that day belonged to Majd al-Azmi, a neighbour and friend, who was arrested during the operation and remains in Israeli custody. All three men say they were unarmed, and all were quickly released by the army after identity checks. The Israeli human rights group, Btselem, has been tracking the cases. Its spokesman, Shai Parnes, said that since the 7 October Hamas attacks, violence against Palestinians in the West Bank by Israeli soldiers and settlers has reached record levels. Its more radicalised, its more brutalised, its more extreme, he said. Since 7 October, more than 500 Palestinians have been killed  more than 100 of them minors  and every day there are invasions of Palestinian cities. Jenin has been a particular target for Israeli raids since the 7 October Hamas attacks, with more than 120 Palestinians  civilians and fighters  killed by Israeli soldiers there. But armed men still patrol Jenin camp where fighters backed by Hamas and Islamic Jihad are based, and residents in the town say theres no sign of the war subsiding. What the army doesnt know is that resistance is an idea planted in the heart, one resident said. It wont stop. If one is killed, five more will replace him. During an Israeli operation this week, bombs buried deep in the roads around the camp hit two units as they came in  killing one soldier and wounding 16 others. This battle began long before the Gaza War, but tactics and attitudes here are shifting in its wake, and the behaviour of Israeli troops is under scrutiny in the West Bank too. This is different territory to Gaza, but its the same enemies, locked in the same wider war. Two more Palestinian men, injured during a military operation in the occupied West Bank last week, have told the BBC that Israeli soldiers forced them onto the bonnet of an army jeep and drove them  sometimes at speed  along village roads. Their accounts came days after footage of 23-year-old Mujahid Abadi Balas clinging to the bonnet of what appears to be the same Israeli army jeep sparked international outrage. The BBC has now spoken to two men who allege similar treatment during the operation in Jabariyat, on the outskirts of Jenin, last Saturday. 25-year-old Samir Dabaya, now in hospital in Jenin, says he was shot in the back by Israeli forces during the Jabariyat operation, and lay face-down and bleeding for hours, until soldiers came to assess him. When they turned him over and found that he was alive, he was beaten with a gun, he says, before being picked up, carried to the jeep and thrown onto it. They took off my [trousers]. I wanted to hold onto the car, but [one soldier] hit my face and told me not to.

Mother died after doctors missed heart problem,"Mrs Fuentebaja moved to the UK from the Philippines in 2001 with her husband, Darrel Fuentebaja. ""It was a really traumatic time when my wife died,"" he said. ""As a nurse herself she was really committed to helping others and she helped to save many lives. ""Unfortunately, when the time came when she needed that help, she was failed and it cost her life."" Mr Fuentebaja said he went into a deep depression for about a year and worried what would happen to his children if anything happened to him. ""I was left feeling very angry and bitter about that, and the mistakes that were made, and that is why I pursued legal action for her. I wanted justice for her,"" he said. As part of the legal case, led by Elizabeth Maliakal of Hudgell Solicitors, West Midlands Ambulance Service admitted breaching its duty of care as paramedics failed to identify potential cardiac issues, despite an echocardiogram (ECG) showing disturbances and her loss of consciousness. It also admitted that Mrs Fuentebaja should have been advised to go to hospital that day. Mrs Fuentebaja's first ECG test showed disturbances in her heartbeat, but ambulance workers recorded this as being related to anxiety and she was told she did not need to go to hospital. South Warwickshire NHS Foundation Trust admitted that failing to refer Mrs Fuentebaja to cardiology and failing to place her on constant heart monitoring was also a breach of duty on its own part. It admitted that had this happened, the 40-year-old nurse would have been correctly diagnosed and treated, and even if she had still suffered the cardiac arrest, she would have received swift defibrillation and resuscitation, and would have survived. Mrs Maliakal called the case ""incredibly tragic and heart-breaking"". She said: ""Mrs Fuentebajas death was wholly avoidable. Had she been given appropriate treatment and care she would still be with her family today, but she was let down by two separate health providers. ""The missed opportunities to provide timely treatment led to the loss of a much-loved mother, wife and daughter who was the main provider for her family."" A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: We would again like to apologise to the family of Rose Fuentebaja and offer our condolences. The trust undertook an investigation into the incident, which we have learned from. As a result we have implemented a number of changes based on the findings. We will continue to do all we can to try and stop something like this ever happening again. A spokesperson for South Warwickshire University NHS Foundation Trust said: ""We express our heartfelt condolences to Rosalies family and friends. ""At the time of her death in 2017 we thoroughly investigated any missed opportunities and following that implemented learning across the organisation. Follow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Mother of four 'traumatised' by council flat mould,"A mother of four from south-east London says her family have been ""traumatised"" by living in mouldy conditions for eight years. Glory Uhunarabona, 45, from Bermondsey, said Southwark Council had failed to address the root cause of mould in her home for years. They were moved into temporary accommodation twice while the problem was supposed to have been sorted, but ""the damp won't go away"", she said. Southwark Council says Ms Uhunarabona's flat is in ""unacceptable condition"". Ms Uhunarabona said three of her children, aged 14, 13 and eight, have been regularly suffering with nosebleeds - something that began two years after they moved into the ground-floor flat. Doctors have written medical letters for the council numerous times about the mouldy conditions and their impact on Ms Uhunarabona's eight-year-old asthmatic daughter, but with no impact, she said. ""They cough and sneeze and blood just comes,"" Ms Uhunarabona said. ""Seeing my children bleeding, I feel traumatised... I feel depressed for them."" Ms Uhunarabona said she felt ""abandoned"" and could no longer cope with the repeated return of mould to her home. She said it took over both the bathroom and one of the three bedrooms. ""These children are stressed,"" she said. ""There is nothing we can do."" The family have been moved out of their home into temporary accommodation twice, she said. Once was to Bromley in 2020 and also to Wandsworth in 2022. During the first move, the carpets in their flat were ripped up and furniture was broken and left strewn across the flat, she said. Each time the family have gone back to their home, the mould has returned, she said. A spokesperson for Southwark Council said: These are unacceptable conditions for anyone to live in, and we apologise to Ms Uhunarabona and her family for how distressing it must have been for the mould to return for a second time when she went back to her property. ""There is clearly a specific issue with this property which our repairs teams will need to address to permanently resolve the mould and condensation. ""We will also look into all the matters Ms Uhunarabona has raised and speak to her about both her familys housing situation and what has happened. Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Mum of girl injured on funfair ride wants 'justice',"The mother of an 11-year-old girl who was injured when a funfair ride malfunctioned at a country show in south London said she wanted ""answers and justice"". Silvana-Rose, from south-east London, is still on crutches after suffering injuries to her legs, pelvis and lower back in the incident at the Lambeth Country Show on 8 June. Her grandfather, who went to the fair with her, sustained a broken nose and two other people - a man and a woman in their 40s - were injured and remain in hospital, where their injuries are not life-threatening. Lambeth Council said an investigation into the incident, led by the Met Police and Health and Safety Executive, was under way. Police said inquiries continued. Silvana-Rose said she and her grandfather were on the ride when they ""saw a lady hanging head first and then she was bashing everywhere"". ""I don't remember what hit me,"" she said.

NatWest to buy Sainsbury's banking arm,"NatWest is to buy the main banking business of Sainsbury's as the supermarket chain withdraws from the sector in order to focus on food. Under the deal, NatWest will take on the credit cards, loans and savings accounts of  Sainsbury's Bank. However, it is not buying the Sainsbury's Bank brand, or its cash machines, insurance or travel money businesses. Customers will see no immediate change as a result of the deal, Sainsbury's said, and ""do not need to take any action"". Sainsbury's said it would seek to redeploy employees at risk of losing their jobs as part of a consultation process. Although NatWest is not automatically taking on those Sainsbury's employees as part of the deal, a spokeswoman for the supermarket said ""both parties are committed to exploring opportunities for ongoing employment with NatWest"". She declined to say how many employees would be affected. NatWest said it would gain about one million customer accounts as part of the deal, which is expected to complete at the end of March next year. The bank will take on £1.4bn of unsecured personal loans and £1.1bn of credit card balances, as well as £2.6bn of customer deposits. Sainsbury's Bank will pay out £125m to NatWest and £250m to Sainsbury's as part of the agreement. nan nan Sainsbury's Bank started as a joint venture with the Bank of Scotland in 1997, before Sainsbury's took full ownership in 2014 But the supermarket said in January that it planned to wind down its banking division in order to focus on its core food business. Sainsbury's is not the only supermarket to have pulled out of the banking sector. In February, Tesco sold its retail banking operations to Barclays in a deal worth £600m. Barclays bought Tesco Bank's credit cards, loans and savings accounts and also agreed to market Tesco-branded banking services."

Netanyahu: Israeli forces will move to Lebanon border as Rafah winds down,"Hezbollah has been launching missiles, rockets and drones into northern Israel in support of Hamas since the day after the 7 October attacks in southern Israel, when gunmen from Gaza killed about 1,200 people and took 251 others as hostages. More than 37,620 people have been killed in Gaza during the military campaign that Israel launched in response, according to the Palestinian territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Mr Netanyahu suggested in his interview with Israeli Channel 14 TV on Sunday that the seven-week Israeli operation in Rafah - which has displaced more than a million Palestinians - would be the last major offensive of the war. ""The intense phase of the fighting against Hamas is about to end,"" he said. ""It doesn't mean that the war is about to end, but the war in its intense phase is about to end in Rafah."" Israeli forces would continue mowing the grass all the time, he added. We will not give up. Mr Netanyahu also said he was ready for a partial deal that would secure the release of the remaining 116 hostages still in captivity - 41 of whom are presumed dead - but that he was committed to completing the goal of destroying Hamas. Hamas, which is demanding a permanent ceasefire and full Israeli withdrawal as part of any deal, said the comment showed the prime ministers clear rejection of the proposal outlined last month by US President Joe Biden and backed by the UN Security Council. The first phase of the plan - which Mr Biden said had been put forward by Israel - would last six weeks and include a temporary ceasefire that would see the release of some of the hostages. The second phase would see all the other living hostages freed during a permanent cessation of hostilities, with the latter subject to further negotiations. In a speech at Israels parliament on Monday, Mr Netanyahu said his position has not changed and that he remained committed to the Israeli proposal welcomed by President Biden. Later, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum released graphic video footage, filmed by Hamas gunmen, showing the abduction on 7 October of three of the remaining hostages - Hersh Goldberg-Polin, 23, Or Levy, 33, and Eliya Cohen, 26. We must approve and implement an agreement that will bring all hostages home - the living for rehabilitation and the murdered for proper burial! the forum said. Hamas also condemned the reported killing on Sunday of eight people in an Israeli air strike on a vocational college in Gaza City run by the UN Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, which was being used as an aid distribution point. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said buildings were being used for military purposes by Hamas, which the group rejected as a lie. The IDF announced on Monday that it had killed a Hamas commander responsible for projects and development at the groups weapons manufacturing headquarters in an overnight air strike, without giving a location. It also said troops were continuing to carry out raids in the Rafah area, and that they had located weapons, dismantled several underground tunnel shafts and eliminated a number of armed terrorists. According to the IDF, chief of staff Lt Gen Herzi Halevi told troops in Rafah: ""We are clearly approaching the point where we can say we have dismantled the Rafah Brigade, that it is defeated not in the sense that there are no more terrorists, but in the sense that it can no longer function as a fighting unit. Mr Netanyahu said that once the current phase of the Gaza war was over, Israeli forces would face north. He stated that the redeployment of troops to the border with Lebanon would be first and foremost for defensive purposes, but that it would also allow tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by Hezbollah rocket and missile attacks to return home. If we can, we will do this diplomatically. If not, we will do it in another way. But we will bring all [the residents] home. Israel wants Hezbollah to agree to withdraw its fighters several kilometres back from the border, in line with a UN Security Council resolution passed at the end of their war in 2006. However, Hezbollah says there will be no ceasefire agreement before there is one in Gaza. In addition to forcing tens of thousands of residents in northern Israel to flee their homes, Hezbollahs attacks have so far killed at least 25 people in Israel. The IDF has responded with air and artillery strikes in Lebanon, which the UN says have reportedly killed more than 400 people and displaced tens of thousands. The cross-border exchanges have been intensifying in recent weeks, along with threats from both sides. On Monday, the IDF said fighter jets had struck a number of Hezbollah terror targets in southern Lebanon overnight, including a military structure in Aitaroun and infrastructure in Kfarkela and Khiam. Lebanons state-run National News Agency said there had been an air strike on a house in Aitaroun and that no casualties were reported. The IDF also said two Israeli reservists in a local security team had been injured, one seriously, by a Hezbollah anti-tank missile attack in the Israeli border town of Metula on Sunday night. On Sunday, the chairman of the US militarys joint chiefs of staff warned that an Israeli offensive in Lebanon could drive up the potential for a broader conflict that draws in Iran and other Iran-backed groups. ""Hezbollah is more capable than Hamas as far as overall capability, number rockets and the like. And I would just say I would see Iran be more inclined to provide greater support to Hezbollah,"" General CQ Brown told reporters. He also said it would be harder for the US to defend Israel from attacks by Hezbollah than it was during Irans attack on Israel in April, when almost all of the drones and missiles it launched were intercepted. His remarks came as Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant visited Washington to discuss the next phase of the Gaza war and Hezbollah. Before leaving, Mr Gallant said Israel was prepared for any action that may be required in Gaza, Lebanon, and in more areas. Last week, the IDF confirmed that operational plans for an offensive against Hezbollah had been approved and Foreign Minister Israel Katz warned that Hezbollah would be destroyed in an all-out war. Hezbollahs leader, Hassan Nasrallah, said it was not interested in a full-scale conflict, but that if one breaks out there will be no place safe in Israel. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said people in the region could not afford Lebanon to become another Gaza."

A 100-mile new walking and cycling route linking 36 churches across North Wiltshire is being officially opened on Sunday. The Athelstan Pilgrim Way takes in some of the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the historic churches range from Bremilham, the smallest church in England to Malmesbury Abbey. Historian and 'The Rest is History' podcaster Tom Holland, who is a patron of the project, will open the new walk with a speech. The route takes its name from the first King of a united England, Athelstan, a Christian ruler who chose Malmesbury as his capital and was buried in Malmesbury Abbey after his death in 939AD.

New Attenborough portrait by Jonathan Yeo unveiled,"He added that his work has only been possible thanks to the natural history film makers and scientists who have shared their skills. Yeo, who has also painted Sir Tony Blair and Malala Yousafzai, said it was ""a huge honour"" to be asked to paint Sir David's portrait, calling him ""a personal inspiration"". ""It has been a thrill as well as a privilege to spend so much time with someone whose wisdom is so deep and broad, and who is also such brilliant and entertaining company, he said. For the portrait of Charles, Yeo chose a striking red colour. Last month, animal-rights protesters attacked the painting in a London art gallery, sticking posters on the glass covering. The painting itself was unharmed. For Sir David, Yeo said he opted for an ""ambiguous natural green background"", as if he ""might be emerging from one of the many habitats he has captured on film during his career. Sir David was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1983 for his services to science as a pioneer of public engagement. The Royal Society said the new portrait celebrates the role Sir David continues to play in educating audiences everywhere on climate change and biodiversity. Its head of library and archives, Keith Moore, said the body was ""thrilled"" to have the portrait as part of their collections. ""The Royal Society has many pictures of great scientists,"" he said, listing the likes of Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein and Dorothy Hodgkin. ""But Id defy you to find anyone who has touched as many peoples lives in explaining the ideas behind great science, and how they affect our world, as Sir David Attenborough. Hes one of a kind. The portrait will be on public display at the Royal Society from 2 July."

New charity removes financial barriers for sports,"A new Manx charity dedicated to removing financial barriers to sports will provide ""long-term benefits"" as well as ""short-term enjoyment"", a co-founder has said. PlayMaker will make activities outside of school available to children who would not be able to afford it, by funding equipment, transport costs, access to facilities or affiliation fees. Co-founder Rebekah Dalrymple said sports had provided her son with confidence, community and a career, but many children on the island do not have that same opportunity. Launched this week, the charity is planning to start offering its services from September, where individuals can apply directly or can be referred by schools, other third sector organisations or sports clubs. Mrs Dalrymple added they ""feel really passionately about sports"" and the charity does not want there to be children on the Isle of Man who do not have access  because of finances. While sports provides physical health benefits, it also develops skills such as becoming more reliable, resilience by ""understanding that decisions do not always go your way"" and working in a team. For those who want more time outside of school to learn or play a sport, the organisation  wants to give children ""the opportunity to give it a go"" regardless of ability levels. Having spoken to other local charities, representatives from Manx sport and recreation and teachers, Mrs Dalrymple said ""the more people we have spoken to, the wider the scope of the charity has become"". This was because people were already being identified as being able to benefit from the services. The next steps for PlayMaker is trying to raise funds, setting up processes and finding a premises, before it can receive applications in September. Those who would be eligible to use the services include recipients of free school meals, social security benefits young carers or food bank users. Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

New family immigration visa rules 'penalise couples',"A family visa is required for a British citizen or settled resident wanting to bring a foreign partner or spouse, and potentially children, to live in the UK together. The minimum income required to sponsor a foreign spouse coming to the UK via the Family Visa scheme has now increased from £18,600 to £29,000. The Government plans to increase this further, in stages, to £38,700 by next spring. The minimum income requirement applies to the spouse already living in the UK. In 2020, the UK was placed second from bottom among 56 countries for ease of family reunion, ranking only above Denmark, according to the Migrant Integration Policy Index. Caroline Coombs, who lives in Bristol, co-founded Reunite Families UK - a non-profit organisation supporting families navigating the visa process. The group started on Facebook in 2017 and has grown to almost 4,500 members. Ms Coombs' husband, who is from Ecuador, faced being deported to his home country shortly after the couple - already married at the time - welcomed their first child. Eight years on, Caroline's husband Carlos is still in the process of gaining indefinite leave to remain, which would secure his future in the UK. Another family struggling to come to terms with the new rules are Gary Pepperd and ""the love of [his] life"", Shayenne. Mr Pepperd was living in Bristol when he met Shayenne. She is Brazilian and was living in Brazil when they connected through social media. ""After a while, we started developing feelings until it got to a point where we wanted to be together,"" said Mr Pepperd. Shayenne came to the UK on a visitor visa and the couple's relationship flourished. They got married in December 2017. The pair had planned to live together in the city, but the option to apply for a family visa wasn't available to them, as Mr Pepperd earned below the previous minimum income requirement of £18,600. As a result, Mr Pepperd said he decided to move to Brazil so the couple could be together. ""I still have a house in Bristol that I would love to live in with my wife,"" he said. ""But the [visa] application process is very expensive and it would mean being separated for a long time. ""I would need to leave my wife, find a job there, collect six months of payslips before I'd be allowed to apply and potentially wait another six months to get an answer. ""Now, it just got even harder,"" he added. As highlighted in a recent BBC Panorama episode ""Immigration: the UK's Record Rise"", last year, the Government issued 1.44 million visas. Only around 5.6% of those were family-related. In response, a Home Office spokesperson said in a statement: ""The?current levels of migration to the UK are far too high. ""That is why the government announced a plan to cut the number of migrants coming to the UK by 300,000 a year  the largest reduction ever. By tethering the minimum income requirement to the general salary threshold for skilled workers, it ensures migration policy is supportive of the wider ambition for the UK to be a high-wage, high-productivity, high-skill economy."
New homes: What's happened to the government's housebuilding target?,"In July 2023, the Levelling Up Committee of MPs warned that the government was not on track to meet the target, but said it might still fulfil its other goal to build one million homes during this Parliament. The target, set out in the 2019 Conservative manifesto, is for ""300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s"". The figure, which is for England, was unveiled by then-Chancellor Philip Hammond in November 2017. ""Experts agree that 300,000 new homes a year would start to make inroads on the affordability of housing,"" he told BBC News at the time. The manifesto also pledged to build at least a million more homes by the end of this Parliament, which will be December 2024 at the latest - five years since the current Parliament first sat. And the government proposed changes to the planning system to help build more houses, but was accused of watering these down after some Conservative MPs threatened to rebel. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had been trying to introduce binding targets for local councils, but the government said: ""Housing targets remain, but are a starting point, with new flexibilities to reflect local circumstances."" In 2019-20 there were 248,591 ""net additional dwellings"", but this fell to 217,754 in 2020-21, partly due to the pandemic. In both 2021-22 and 2022-23 the figures were just under 235,000 a year. ""Net additional dwellings"" is the headline figure for housebuilding, and includes houses being converted to flats or commercial buildings switching to domestic use, as well as new builds. It also reflects demolished houses. ""The government will miss [its] 300,000-homes-a-year manifesto pledge by a country mile,"" former Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told MPs on 10 May 2022. He predicted that 2019-20 total of 248,591 would be ""the high watermark of the number of homes built in this country for several years to come"". In terms of the target of building one million homes during this Parliament, 935,204 additional homes have been built in England since April 2019. However, that overstates the total, as this Parliament did not begin until 19 December 2019. The total built since April 2020 is 686,613, although this ignores houses built between December 2019 and March 2020. On average, almost 250,000 homes were built in England in each year of the 1970s. But there was also a great deal of demolition, largely due to slum clearance, which made the overall net figure just under 200,000 a year. The 1990s saw many fewer homes built but also fewer demolitions, taking the overall average to about 150,000 a year. This annual figure then rose until the 2007-08 financial crisis, when housebuilding stalled, before recovering in the mid-2010s. Even hitting the annual target wouldn't necessarily address the current housing shortages if they are the wrong sort of properties, according to housing charity Shelter. ""There is no point in building 300,000 homes a year if the vast majority are overpriced flats and houses that people on average or lower incomes can't afford,"" it said. ""The government must make sure any target it sets will deliver the genuinely affordable social homes this country needs."" The government's 2020 Social Housing White Paper renewed its affordable-homes commitments for 2021-26. An £11.5bn programme is supposed to deliver up to 180,000 new homes over that period, half offering affordable ownership and half offering discounted rent. The government's latest figures on affordable-housing supply show 63,605 affordable homes were completed in England in 2022-23, an increase of 7% from the previous year. These homes are classified as having: When Mr Hammond announced the 300,000-a-year target in November 2017, the UK average house price was £224,453, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The latest figures for September 2023 show an average price of £291,385, an increase of 30%. For comparison, over the same period, the consumer price index (CPI) measure of inflation has risen by 26%. What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"
New portrait of King released for Armed Forces Day,"In a her video message, recorded at Clarence House, the Queen reflected on the ""incredible bravery"" of the military personnel who began the liberation of Europe from Nazi Germany in 1944. She said that 80 years on, the ""same spirit and those same qualities remain much in evidence throughout our Armed Forces"", who ""undertake your duties in the face of a multitude of challenges and dangers"". The Queen added: ""In so doing, you not only protect these Isles, but also defend liberties way beyond these shores. ""Your determination, unrelenting efforts and selfless loyalty to each other and to the United Kingdom are as enduring as our gratitude."" The patron of the British Forces Broadcasting Service charity, which produced the video, also thanked the families of servicemen and women ""who keep the home fires burning"" while their loved ones are overseas. Noting her father, Major Bruce Shand, and his own role in North Africa and Dunkirk in World War Two - the latter of which earned him the Military Cross - the Queen said: ""As the proud daughter of an Army officer, I know something of the impact military life has on your loved ones. You too are heroes. ""In times of war and in times of peace, whether seen or unseen, our armed forces support and strengthen our nation. You are a source of inspiration, reassurance and pride - and I salute you all."""

Night at the Museum actor Bill Cobbs dies aged 90,"Cobbs was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1934. Before becoming an actor, he served eight years in the US air force, and sold cars in the years after his service. He began acting after a customer asked him if he wanted to appear in a play, and Cobbs made his first stage appearance in 1969. A year later, he moved to New York to pursue further acting work. His first film role came in 1974 with a brief appearance in crime drama The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, launching a decades-long career on the big and small screen. In 2020, Cobbs won a Daytime Emmy for his appearance in Dino Dana, a Canadian childrens educational show. The actor's brother Thomas G Cobbs remembered him as ""a beloved partner, big brother, uncle, surrogate parent, godfather and friend"". ""Bill recently and happily celebrated his 90th birthday surrounded by cherished loved ones, he wrote on Facebook. ""As a family we are comforted knowing Bill has found peace and eternal rest with his Heavenly Father. We ask for your prayers and encouragement during this time.""

North Korea cracking down on wedding dresses and slang - report,"What exactly the punishment is for these infractions is unclear. However, the crackdown on South Korean-made culture appears more severe. A 2020 law made watching or distributing South Korean entertainment punishable by death. This year's report includes an account of a public execution which had earlier been revealed by the BBC, where a 22-year-old farmer was killed for listening to 70 songs, watching three films and distributing them. It is thought to be the only account of an execution being carried out under the ""reactionary ideology and culture rejection law"" to emerge so far. A video from earlier this year showed two teenagers being sentenced to hard labour for a similar crime. The South Korean report has been released at a time of increasing tensions between the neighbouring countries. The North has sent more than 2,000 balloons filled with rubbish across the border since last month - some of which were found to have parasites inside. A meeting between Kim Jong Un and Russia's Vladimir Putin last week has further strained relations. It is notable, then, that this is only the second time the report has been released, despite having been compiled annually since 2018. They were previously not released in order to avoid provoking North Korea."
North Korea says it fired a new weapon  - is it lying?,"South Korea's military however was quick to debunk these claims, saying the ""flight was not normal"" and that the weapon had exploded mid-flight. It released a video it had filmed of the test, saying that the initial stage showed an unstable flight that led to a mid-air explosion. Military officials said they detected a large amount of debris, more than what should result from a successful test. They also said North Korea's pictures purportedly showing the warheads and decoy separating from the missile were actually pictures of an intercontinental ballistic missile test carried out in March. Analysts cited by South Korean news agency Yonhap pointed out that the range of the test was more typically seen in intercontinental ballistic missile tests. They also believed the missile may have had insufficient guidance and control systems. Other experts believe some parts of the test succeeded - though much remains unknown. Yang Uk, a researcher at Asan Institute for Policy Studies, told the BBC that while he believed the flight and separation of warheads had worked, ""North Korea has not revealed evidence whether the warheads reached their targets - we cannot say they succeeded here"". Japan's defence ministry said the missile achieved a maximum altitude of 100km. This meant it did not enter outer space and instead stayed in the Earth's atmosphere. Dr Yang said this also meant that ""the warheads were not tested for the high heat and pressure that follow re-entry into atmosphere, so we cannot know their capabilities"". The weapons test was spotted by South Koreans living by the border, and a video carried by South Korean media taken by a civilian observer showed a visible contrail in the sky. North Korean weapons expert and former US State Department official Vann Van Diepen said the video ""does not seem to indicate a big explosion or catastrophic failure"", and the contrail appeared consistent with North Korean state media photos. ""But that does not rule out a more subtle failure,"" he added, noting that there was no independent proof that warheads were released and successfully flew on their own. Whatever the truth of the test's success, what is clearer is that North Korea would still have reaped some gains. Observers point out that Pyongyang would have obtained useful technical data from the launch, putting them one step closer to achieving MIRV capability, a goal publicly set by North Korea's government in 2021. MIRV missiles would be prized given their ""productivity"", said Mr Van Diepen, particularly in a situation where North Korea may have a depleted missile arsenal following a first strike from an enemy. This week's test, even if successful, would not be enough to complete the development of such a weapon, but he estimated the North Koreans were ""at least a few years away"" from that goal. The timing of the test - days before an expected plenary meeting where North Korean officials will gather to review their work in the first half of the year - may not be coincidental. It could be aimed at showcasing the military's achievements, say other experts. It would also have sent a message of continued defiance and a signal of the country's developing capabilities to its enemies. Washington has said little in response to the latest test, apart from releasing a short joint statement with Japan and South Korea condemning it. But Mr Van Diepen said the US government, which would have the best resources to analyse North Korea's weapons tests, could and should shed more light. ""Otherwise, the North gets a free propaganda win."" Additional reporting by Jake Kwon and Rachel Lee A weapons test this week has become the latest point of contention between North and South Korea, with Pyongyang saying they fired an advanced multiple warhead missile and Seoul accusing them of lying. Hours after North Korean state media lauded the ""success"" of their test and ran pictures as proof on Thursday, the South called it ""deception and exaggeration"" and released their own evidence pointing towards failure. Analysts meanwhile remain uncertain about the truth of the North's claims. The dispute underscores the complexities of verifying North Korea's weapons development, which continues to advance despite severe international sanctions. If North Korea's latest claims are true, it would represent significant progress in their missile programme. Multiple warhead missiles are difficult to defend against and the technology is challenging to develop. Currently only the US - which first developed it in the 1960s - as well as the UK, France, Russia and China are known to have these capabilities. Pyongyang is now trumpeting that they are a step closer to achieving it as well. For some time now, experts have floated the possibility of North Korea eventually developing MIRV capabilities. MIRV stands for multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle. The technology involves attaching several warheads to a single missile that would separate after launch. The warheads would then be powered by their own rockets to hit various targets. They can be released at different speeds and in multiple directions, allowing them to hit targets hundreds of kilometres apart from one another. This is what makes these weapons particularly efficient. Pyongyang said on Thursday that it had ""successfully conducted the separation and guidance control test of individual mobile warheads"" the day before. The weapon, it said, used the first-stage engine of an intermediate-range solid-fuel ballistic missile, and deployed three warheads plus a decoy. The missile travelled a ""shortened range"" of 170 to 200km (105 to 124 miles) to ensure safety and measure the flights of the warheads, said state media. The warheads were each ""guided correctly"" to their targets while anti-air radar found the decoy had effectively deployed as well. The test was of ""great significance in bolstering"" their missile forces and was aimed at ""securing the MIRV capability"", which has been set as a top priority. nan South Korea's military however was quick to debunk these claims, saying the ""flight was not normal"" and that the weapon had exploded mid-flight. It released a video it had filmed of the test, saying that the initial stage showed an unstable flight that led to a mid-air explosion.

Nuclear weapons pose a risk to proposed new homes,"Development consultants Pegasus Group submitted the plans for up to 475 homes in May. While not a formal planning application, the submission hopes to determine if a development would affect the environment, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). But in a letter to the council, AWE said the plans raised ""significant"" safety concerns. It said the proposed site, between Basingstoke Lane and Sussex Lane, fell within its Detailed Emergency Planning Zone (DEPZ). This is an area where neighbouring West Berkshire Council must have a detailed plan in place for its response to a nuclear emergency at Burghfield. AWE said: Whilst chances of a radiation emergency at AWE B are very low, the potential impact on the local population would be high and an appropriate and proportionate step is, to where possible, avoid new development being located within the DEPZ. It added the increased population in the area would also put strain on emergency services ability to help existing residents in the event of an emergency. Wokingham Borough Councils own emergency planning manager also said he would likely oppose the proposals if developers Richborough applied for planning permission.

Nuns plan to turn convent into key worker flats,"Nuns in south London want to turn part of their convent into flats for key workers like nurses and teachers. Sisters of the Holy Family Convent have submitted plans to Lambeth Council to change a Grade-II listed terrace in Stockwell into five apartments. The religious community has experienced a slump in numbers over the years, resulting in the building becoming empty. The sisters would remain living in a property next door to the proposed apartment building on Albert Square. The squares Grade-II listed terraces were built between 1846 and 1849. They are set around a picturesque garden and are just a 10-minute walk from Stockwell Tube station. According to documents submitted to the council, the conversion is expected to cost up to £2m. Work proposed to be carried out includes the fitting of sprinklers and an evacuation lift, the replacement of roofs and the installation of solar panels. In 2021, a five-bedroom detached house on Albert Square sold for £3.25m and a one-bedroom flat for £425,000.

Nursery glasshouses shattered by 'funnel cloud',"Mr Roberts, owner of Alpha Plants, said: ""It's absolutely devastating. ""We spent 30 years building the business up to one of the UK's big young plant producers and then in 30 seconds the roofs are all down. ""We're standing here with just inches of glass around our feet, twisted bents and glazing bars across the floor. About 2,000 square metres of glass is affected."" Mr Roberts said his insurers were assessing the damage. The glass was tough enough to resist wind speeds of up to 90mph (145 km/h), he said, but ""the twirling and swirling"" of the cloud forced three connecting buildings to smash. ""I just put my head in [my hands] and I was just devastated. There weren't [any] words for it. ""It's really upsetting to see the amount of damage. ""The good thing is we have got a couple of blocks that haven't been touched."" Mr Roberts said he was ""very lucky"" the three glasshouses, which were interconnected, were almost empty as the firm was nearing the end of its growing season. Other businesses had offered alternative spaces to continue with production, he said. ""We're normally producing about 200,000 plugs a week during the main season. Fortunately, this would have been the last week of the season. ""Most of the orders had already gone and the last few that were due to go out were in houses that was unaffected by the damage. So from that point of view, we got away lightly."" According to the Met Office, a funnel cloud is a cone-shaped formation that appears to dangle beneath a larger cloud towards the ground without actually reaching the surface. It is formed when light and variable winds converge, causing spin in the lower levels of the atmosphere. The rotating column of wind draws in cloud droplets, making a region of intense low pressure visible. Funnel clouds are typically associated with cumulonimbus thunderclouds. They are called tornados when they touch the ground and water spouts when they touch water. Follow BBC Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

The latest report said prejudicial language had become the norm, and this had allowed a culture of racist and homophobic banter to develop. Many say that they would not report this behaviour because they are not confident it will be dealt with effectively. They are justified in feeling this way,"" the inspector said. Inspectors also highlighted a high rate of absence among students. There was also a high staff turnover, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Mr Lee, who started in his role last week, said he was focused on moving forward and doing everything"" to bring improvements. Follow BBC Surrey on Facebook and X.

Old issues trouble voters in new constituency,"The number one concern shared by voters was healthcare and the NHS. If prompted, of the 20 people who mentioned it, 10 referred to long waiting times, eight shared concern about a lack of dentistry services, and two said the NHS needed more funding. Another seven called for a new hospital to be delivered. Financial pressures also weighed heavily on people's minds, with 11 wanting their new MP to ease cost of living pressures in general, while four singled out the need for affordable housing, and two argued pensions were too low. Other issues that came up frequently include  as the need for more town centre investment, the poor state of roads, crime and antisocial behaviour and sewage spills into waterways . Cropping up less often were concerns about immigration and public transport . Sixteen people questioned said they had already decided which box to tick on 4 July while nine said they were still on the fence. Will Tanner, Prime Minister Rishi Sunaks deputy chief of staff, is hoping to win the seat for the Conservatives. He said they would create well-paid and highly-skilled jobs to sustain high streets, push for more food to be grown locally, and protect villages from speculative and unplanned development. He also pledged to secure a new hospital in Bury St Edmunds. Dr Peter Prinsley, who has worked as an ear, nose and throat surgeon for about 40 years, is the Labour candidate. He said speaking to residents revealed a disillusion with the government due to a lack of services. Dr Prinsley said healthcare was one of his and voters' top priorities  and that his experience as a surgeon gave him a personal view on how to address NHS issues. He also said he would focus on reversing the impacts of climate change with a coherent and achievable plan that included addressing the issue of sewage spills. Economist Emma Buckmaster is representing the Green Party. She said a lot of people had concerns about the environment and promised to keep nature and the environment at the heart of every decision. Ms Buckmaster also said she would help carry out her partys re-investment plan for public services, including the NHS, public transport, and education, and keep sound financial management and support for business in mind to address cost-of-living pressures. The Candidates: Peter McDonald, who runs an agriculture start-up near Bury St Edmunds, is representing the Liberal Democrats. He said healthcare was at the top of voters agendas, and that issues could be addressed through reform, junior doctor agreements, and more GP appointments. Mr McDonald said housing and the environment also came up during his conversations with residents. He said he would push for rent reforms and the expansion of affordable housing, as well as turning water companies into ""public benefit"" companies. Scott Hussey, who has worked internationally on projects delivering humanitarian aid and HIV protection, is representing Reform UK. He said two issues he would tackle, based on residents concerns, would be immigration levels and the state of the NHS. Mr Hussey said voters had also raised concerns about wasteful government spending and about value for money in relation to projects involving infrastructure, roads, Covid and foreign aid. Richard Baker-Howard is the only Rejoin EU Party candidate standing in Suffolk. He said would put pressure on other parties to work more collaboratively among themselves and with other countries in the EU to address environmental and cost-of-living concerns. Mr Baker-Howard also said he would push for a more open dialogue about rights and opportunities - including workers' rights, environmental protections, and reductions in civil liberties - that people had lost since Britain left the EU. Communist Party candidate Darren Turner, a former local councillor, said his priorities would include addressing the cost and availability of affordable and social housing, protecting the NHS against private investment. He highlighted the lack of NHS dentists as a consequence of private healthcare. Mr Turner also said he would focus on public transport by pushing for the rail system to be brought back into full public ownership. Independent Jeremy Lee said he would push for tighter national regulation, and strict adherence from councils, on large-scale developments in areas without additional infrastructure. He also said he was concerned about depleted rural bus services that could leave people isolated and anxious about getting to appointments. Mr Lee worked with former Boris Johnson, as his agent for speaking appointments, before Mr Johnson became prime minister. He said tens of residents had told him they had never seen Ms Churchill and said an ""invisible MP"" was not good for local democracy.

The former Bury St Edmunds constituency was represented by a Conservative for more than a century, most recently by Jo Churchill, who won with a majority of nearly 25,000 in 2019. She is not standing in the new seat of Bury St Edmunds and Stowmarket this time, but eight candidates are. The Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) questioned 25 people in the constituency to find out what they want from them. nan The number one concern shared by voters was healthcare and the NHS.

One dead as roof collapse smashes cars at Delhi airport,"A roof at Delhi airport has collapsed after heavy rain, killing one person and injuring eight others. Videos online show huge pillars supporting the roof smashing into cars parked along the airport's Terminal 1. All flights from the terminal have been suspended until further notice, airport authorities said. The incident took place at 05:00 (23:30 GMT Thursday). ""While the cause for the collapse is being assessed, the primary cause seems to be the continued heavy rainfall over the past few hours,"" a spokesperson for the airport said. Officials said four vehicles were damaged and eight people received minor injuries in the incident. India's aviation regulator has advised airlines to accommodate passengers on alternate flights or offer them refunds. The accident has impacted the travel plans of thousands, as most domestic flights take off from Terminal 1. Some airlines have shifted flight operations to the remaining two terminals at the airport. Authorities at the Delhi International Airport Limited said a technical committee had been formed to investigate the cause of the accident. ""We are working with all relevant agencies to assess the situation and restore operations,"" they added. Federal Aviation Minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu has announced a compensation of 2m rupees ($24,000; £19,000) to the family of the deceased and 300,000 rupees for the injured. He also told reporters that the situation was under control and that inspection was under way to prevent any further incident. He added that airports with added structures across the country would also be inspected. The incident was criticised on social media, with many users pointing out that the terminal had undergone a massive renovation at the cost of billions of rupees and had been inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in March  a month before the recent general election began. However, Mr Kinjarapu later said the portion that collapsed was not part of the renovated section. I want to clarify that the building inaugurated by PM Modi is on the other side and the building that collapsed here is an old building and was opened in 2009,"" he said. Heavy rains have lashed Delhi since Thursday, providing a much-needed respite from sweltering temperatures that the Indian capital was experiencing since April. But the downpour has pushed the city into chaos as several roads are water-logged, leading to major traffic jams. Commuters reported spending hours in traffic while others said their vehicles had suffered breakdowns. Videos shared on social media showed people wading through knee-deep water and cars and buses partly submerged in subways. The torrential downpour has also led to delays and cancellations of flights. India's meteorological department forecasts that the city will continue to see ""heavy to very heavy rainfall"" over the weekend.

Orangutans produce sounds 'like beatboxers',"Orangutans are able to make two separate sounds at the same time in a similar way to humans who beatbox, a new study suggests. The results provide clues about the evolution of human speech, researchers with the University of Warwick said. In Borneo, they saw male orangutans produce noises known as ""chomps"" at the same time as ""grumbles"" before fights. This brought to mind beatboxers as they ""battle between themselves to settle a winner"", Dr Adriano Lameira said. The team also saw female orangutans in Sumatra produce ""kiss squeak"" sounds at the same time as ""rolling calls"" as they tried to alert other apes of a possible attack by predators. They studied the primates across 3,800 hours and found several of them used the same vocal ability. The comparison in humans would be the use of lips, the tongue and jaw to produce consonant sounds and the larynx to produce vowel sounds, Dr Lameira said. ""This of course is very difficult to achieve even for us,"" he said and added it was best seen in beatboxing. Beatboxers can produce several sounds at the same time using the air in their mouth to make the sounds and rhythms of hip-hop music. But as humans were able to do this, there were longstanding questions about where the ability came from, co-author Dr Madeleine Hardus said. ""We know now the answer could lie within the evolution of our ancestors,"" she added. The vocal abilities of wild great apes have been underestimated compared to birds who can produce two sounds together when they sing, the researchers said. However it was difficult with birds to make comparisons to human speech because of the lack of similar anatomies. ""Now that we know this vocal ability is part of the great ape repertoire, we can't ignore the evolutionary links,"" Dr Lameira said. ""It could be possible that early human language resembled something that sounded more like beatboxing, before evolution organised language into the consonant and vowel structure that we know today.""

PM insists UK better place to live now than in 2010,"Rishi Sunak has insisted the UK is a better place to live now than in 2010, when the Conservatives came into government. In one of his last big interviews before Thursday's general election, the prime minister said the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine had made life ""difficult for everyone"" but added that the country was now ""on the right track"". Labour said prices in shops, NHS waiting lists and mortgages had risen under the Conservatives and that it was excruciating to watch Rishi Sunak just gloss over the concerns of ordinary working people"". Speaking to the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Sunak rejected a ""declinist narrative"", and defended Brexit saying it was ""utterly wrong"" to suggest the UK had lost its standing in the world since leaving the EU. Appearing on the same programme, Labour's election co-ordinator Pat McFadden said he thought relations with the EU could be better but ruled out a return to freedom of movement as part of any negotiations. He said Labour would not sign up to anything that wasn't in the UK's interest. ""The point is to try, the point is to say can we do better than we are doing at present can we deal with some of these barriers to trade affecting so many of our businesses."" Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the current Brexit deal was ""botched"" and that her party wanted to see free movement for under-35s to work or study in Europe. She also suggested immigration was too high but avoided putting a figure on what she thought the limit should be. nan On 4 July, Mr Sunak will be hoping to secure another term in government for his party - the fifth since 2010, when David Cameron led a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Asked if the UK had become a better or worse place to live over the past 14 years, Mr Sunak said it was better. He said Covid and the war in Ukraine had driven up people's bills but added that his government had made progress on tackling those problems. ""Inflation back to normal, the economy growing again wages rising, energy bills set to fall again, now we are able to cut people's taxes,"" he said. Mr McFadden said that during its time in government the Conservatives had made unfunded promises which had hurt people financially. He said Labour were showing a ""greater degree of financial responsibility"" and that the Conservatvies were offering a ""desperate wish-list of unfunded commitments"". The SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn accused the two main parties of a ""conspiracy of silence"", saying neither were telling voters about the public sector cuts they would implement after the election. On Brexit, Mr Sunak was asked if he thought leaving the EU had damaged the UK's economy and standing in the world. Mr Sunak - who backed Brexit during the 2016 referendum - said it had changed the UK's trading relations but argued it had also enabled the government to cut red tape for businesses and sign new trade deals. ""People are queuing up to work with us because they respect what we do. I completely reject that - it is entirely wrong this declinist narrative people have of the UK,"" he said. He also pointed to an agreement with the US and Australia to build submarines and the role the UK played in supporting Ukraine. He also dismissed suggestions - made by the Climate Change Committee - that the UK had lost its standing as a world leader on climate change. Mr Sunak argued the UK had decarbonised faster than other countries and defended his decision to row back on some previous climate commitments, saying he didn't want to ""saddle"" UK taxpayers with extra costs. During the interview, Mr Sunak was also asked about a racial slur directed at him by a Reform UK canvasser. The prime minister said the comments were ""vile and racist and wrong"". He said there was a ""clear difference"" between how Reform UK leader Nigel Farage had handled the row and his own actions when Tory donor Frank Hester made racist comments about the politician Diane Abbott. He said Mr Hester had apologised and been ""genuinely contrite"" whereas the Reform canvasser Andrew Parker had shown no remorse. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Farage said the canvasser had been putting on ""an act"" and his comments had been ""a deliberate attempt to de-rail our campaign"". He said he had had to disown a dozen of his candidates over comments they made adding: ""I've got some people there I'd rather weren't there, and they won't be after next Thursday at all."" After his comments were broadcast by Channel 4, Mr Parker said: ""Neither Nigel Farage personally or the Reform Party are aware of my personal views on immigration"". I would therefore like to apologise profusely to Nigel Farage and the Reform Party if my personal views have reflected badly on them and brought them into disrepute as this was not my intention."" Rishi Sunak has insisted the UK is a better place to live now than in 2010, when the Conservatives came into government. In one of his last big interviews before Thursday's general election, the prime minister said the Covid pandemic and the war in Ukraine had made life ""difficult for everyone"" but added that the country was now ""on the right track"". Labour said prices in shops, NHS waiting lists and mortgages had risen under the Conservatives and that it was excruciating to watch Rishi Sunak just gloss over the concerns of ordinary working people"". Speaking to the BBC's Sunday With Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Sunak rejected a ""declinist narrative"", and defended Brexit saying it was ""utterly wrong"" to suggest the UK had lost its standing in the world since leaving the EU. Appearing on the same programme, Labour's election co-ordinator Pat McFadden said he thought relations with the EU could be better but ruled out a return to freedom of movement as part of any negotiations. He said Labour would not sign up to anything that wasn't in the UK's interest. ""The point is to try, the point is to say can we do better than we are doing at present can we deal with some of these barriers to trade affecting so many of our businesses."" Liberal Democrat deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the current Brexit deal was ""botched"" and that her party wanted to see free movement for under-35s to work or study in Europe. She also suggested immigration was too high but avoided putting a figure on what she thought the limit should be. nan On 4 July, Mr Sunak will be hoping to secure another term in government for his party - the fifth since 2010, when David Cameron led a coalition with the Liberal Democrats. Asked if the UK had become a better or worse place to live over the past 14 years, Mr Sunak said it was better. He said Covid and the war in Ukraine had driven up people's bills but added that his government had made progress on tackling those problems. ""Inflation back to normal, the economy growing again wages rising, energy bills set to fall again, now we are able to cut people's taxes,"" he said. Mr McFadden said that during its time in government the Conservatives had made unfunded promises which had hurt people financially. He said Labour were showing a ""greater degree of financial responsibility"" and that the Conservatvies were offering a ""desperate wish-list of unfunded commitments"". The SNP's Westminster leader Stephen Flynn accused the two main parties of a ""conspiracy of silence"", saying neither were telling voters about the public sector cuts they would implement after the election. On Brexit, Mr Sunak was asked if he thought leaving the EU had damaged the UK's economy and standing in the world. Mr Sunak - who backed Brexit during the 2016 referendum - said it had changed the UK's trading relations but argued it had also enabled the government to cut red tape for businesses and sign new trade deals. ""People are queuing up to work with us because they respect what we do. I completely reject that - it is entirely wrong this declinist narrative people have of the UK,"" he said. He also pointed to an agreement with the US and Australia to build submarines and the role the UK played in supporting Ukraine. He also dismissed suggestions - made by the Climate Change Committee - that the UK had lost its standing as a world leader on climate change. Mr Sunak argued the UK had decarbonised faster than other countries and defended his decision to row back on some previous climate commitments, saying he didn't want to ""saddle"" UK taxpayers with extra costs. During the interview, Mr Sunak was also asked about a racial slur directed at him by a Reform UK canvasser. The prime minister said the comments were ""vile and racist and wrong"". He said there was a ""clear difference"" between how Reform UK leader Nigel Farage had handled the row and his own actions when Tory donor Frank Hester made racist comments about the politician Diane Abbott. He said Mr Hester had apologised and been ""genuinely contrite"" whereas the Reform canvasser Andrew Parker had shown no remorse. Speaking to Sky News, Mr Farage said the canvasser had been putting on ""an act"" and his comments had been ""a deliberate attempt to de-rail our campaign"". He said he had had to disown a dozen of his candidates over comments they made adding: ""I've got some people there I'd rather weren't there, and they won't be after next Thursday at all.""

Palestinians flee Gaza City's Shejaiya area amid heavy bombardment,"Shejaiya residents and Hamas-affiliated Palestinian media reported a series of Israeli air strikes, artillery shelling and helicopter fire on Thursday morning. Later, they said Israeli ground forces had advanced into eastern areas of the district, which is not far from the Gaza-Israel perimeter fence. A video posted on social media by activist Hema al-Khalili showed people running for cover after what he said was an air strike on a multi-storey building. Other footage appeared to show hundreds of civilians fleeing the area on foot, many of them carrying their belongings, and several injured children being treated at a field hospital. One person told the AFP news agency that the situation in Shejaiya was ""very difficult and frightening"". ""Residents are running through the streets in terror... a number of wounded and martyrs lie in the streets,"" they added. Gaza's Hamas-run Civil Defence force reported strikes on several houses and said its rescue teams had recovered three bodies from the home of one family. Later, it said the death toll in Shejaiya had risen to seven and that more casualties were feared to be under the rubble of destroyed buildings. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not put out a statement about Shejaiya. However, it has mounted similar operations in northern Gaza in recent months in response to what it says is intelligence that Hamas fighters have regrouped there. The IDFs Arabic spokesman posted a message on social media telling residents to leave Shejaiya after the first strikes had been reported. ""For your safety, you must evacuate immediately south on Salah al-Din Street to the humanitarian zone,"" Lt Col Avichay Adraee said, referring to the north-south road used in the early weeks of the war by the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled Gaza City when it was the initial focus of Israel's offensive against Hamas. An attached map featured an arrow pointing south, but it was not clear whether Shejaiya residents were being instructed to head towards the ""al-Mawasi humanitarian area"" running along the coast in southern and central Gaza. That would entail crossing the east-west Israeli military zone south of Gaza City that effectively cuts the territory in half. The al-Mawasi humanitarian area was expanded seven weeks ago, when Israeli ground forces began what they called ""precise"" operations in the southernmost city of Rafah, which they believe is Hamass last stronghold. More than a million displaced people have fled Rafah since then, according to the UN, while the nearby Rafah border crossing with Egypt has been closed since Israeli troops seized control of the Palestinian side. The UN says the crossing's closure has contributed to a significant reduction in the amount of aid reaching southern Gaza. It has also prevented the medical evacuations of critically injured and sick Palestinians who require specialist treatment abroad. On Thursday, 21 children with cancer were reportedly allowed to leave Gaza through the Kerem Shalom goods crossing with Israel for the first time, an Egyptian medical source told AFP. There was no immediate confirmation from Israeli authorities, nor was it clear where they would receive treatment. Palestinians have been fleeing Gaza City's eastern Shejaiya district amid intense Israeli bombardment and a reported incursion by ground forces. One Gaza City resident said it had ""sounded as if the war is restarting"", while Hamas-run authorities said air strikes had killed at least seven people. Palestinian armed groups said they had targeted a tank and a bulldozer east of Shejaiya, where there were fierce battles during an Israeli operation at the end of last year. The Israeli military has not commented on the reports, but it did order residents to evacuate and head southwards. It comes days after Israels prime minister said that ""the intense phase"" of the fighting against Hamas was ""about to end"". The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 37,760 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Shejaiya residents and Hamas-affiliated Palestinian media reported a series of Israeli air strikes, artillery shelling and helicopter fire on Thursday morning.

Palestinians âin mourningâ as Muslims mark Eid al-Adha,"Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank are marking a sombre Eid al-Adha as the Israeli military continues its deadly attacks more than eight months after the start of the war. In the besieged enclave, where more than 37,000 Palestinians have been killed, people gathered in the rubble of their neighbourhoods to pray on Sunday. This is while the Israeli military is aggressively attacking western areas of Rafah as it advances with its ground invasion of the southernmost city, and hitting areas across central Gaza. âThose attacks have pushed people into further internal displacement; in the northern part of the Strip, people are not only struggling to deal with unpredictable falling bombs and attacks on their homes â¦ but also the spread of dehydration and hunger,â said Al Jazeeraâs Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Deir el-Balah in central Gaza. âThis is happening on the first day of Eid, where weâre looking at hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinian families, many of them in mourning.â Al Jazeeraâs Tareq Abu Azzoum, also reporting from Deir el-Balah, said Palestinians are trying to cling to a sense of hope. âPalestinians are trying to do their best, despite Israelâs ongoing aggression, to bring happiness to young children, as many of them will wake up today and celebrate Eid without their parents.â The Government Media Office in Gaza said in a statement late on Saturday that Israel is preventing the entry of sacrificial animals into the enclave from all crossings, preventing Palestinians from performing sacrificial rituals as part of Eid al-Adha. The Israeli army on Sunday announced a âlocal, tactical pauseâ of military activity along a specific route from 8am until 7pm every day until further notice supposedly to allow more aid into Gaza from the Karem Abu Salem (Kerem Shalom) crossing. It did, however, emphasise that its soldiers would continue to fight in the southern part of the enclave and that there would be âno cessation of hostilitiesâ. The pause was slammed as âdelusionalâ by far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, especially since 10 Israeli soldiers were killed on Saturday, marking the deadliest day of the war for Israel since January. In Jerusalem, Israeli forces once again cracked down on Palestinians trying to mark Eid al-Adha in Al-Aqsa Mosque, with the military imposing tight restrictions on entry and assaulting worshippers. The Wafa news agency reported that some 40,000 managed to attend the prayers inside the mosque, but many were forced to pray outside the mosque gates after being denied entry. It also reported that Israeli forces disrupted the movement of Palestinians in several areas across Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, setting up checkpoints and forcing vehicles to stop. nan nan Two senior United Nations officials based in Lebanon warned of a âvery realâ threat of miscalculation that could lead to a wider war as the Israeli military and Hezbollah have significantly ramped up their attacks in border fighting that erupted after the start of the war on Gaza. âAs communities in Lebanon and around the world celebrate Eid al-Adha, the UN family reiterates its call for all actors along theÂ Blue LineÂ to put down their weapons and commit to a path of peace,â the officials said in a joint statement."
Paloma Faith cancels city show due to 'exhaustion',"Faith said she had consulted medical professionals before cancelling the open air performance at the city's Guildhall Square. ""They have advised that I need to rest my voice,"" she said. ""I'm so sorry to everyone who bought tickets, I've loved being on the road and seeing all your gorgeous faces, and I'm gutted I won't be dancing with you tonight."" She was due to perform as part of the Southampton Summer Sessions series, which will conclude this weekend with performances from hip-hop artist Loyle Carner and rock band Kaiser Chiefs. She is due to appear on Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage on Sunday, at London's Eventim Apollo on Wednesday and then at the Utilita Arena Cardiff on Thursday. In a recent interview for the BBC Radio 4 Woman's Hour programme, she discussed the pressures of motherhood, the subject of her newly-published book. She told the programme: ""I think it's really important that we don't just feel that we have to be this kind of social media-worthy presentation of what a parent or mother should be. ""It's normal to be completely bedraggled, covered in your kid's formula milk powder or... sometimes crying in front of your kids. ""It happened recently to me where I was just sort of weeping and I was trying not to draw attention to it. And my seven-year-old was, like: 'Why are your eyes watering?'""

Para surfer 'excited' ahead of national competition,"Ms Veron said she never thought she would be any good at surfing because her conditions affect her balance. Her scoliosis - which has caused her spine to twist and curve to the side - left her with metal rods in her back. She also has a device which helps control her hydrocephalus, a build-up of fluid on the brain. ""I can't stand up on a normal surfboard and I used to think surfing was out of the window until I discovered that para surfing is a thing,"" she said. Ms Veron said heading to the competition organised by Surfing England just a few months after first doing the sport felt intense. ""I'm excited but nervous,"" she said. ""I don't quite know what to expect but I'm just rolling with it."" She said it was important to give everyone the chance to try whatever sport they want. ""I've kind of got the bug now for catching waves, I really like it,"" she said. ""I feel that rush when you catch that wave."" Para surfing instructor Rachel Green has been helping Ms Veron train for the competition. Ms Green, who set up para-surf sessions alongside fellow instructor Rebekah Kellow in Guernsey, said they wanted to get more people on the water. ""It's about broadening surfing in a safe way,"" she said. ""It's all just really exciting."" The English Para Surfing Open is on 4-5 July. Follow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

Parents raise funds decade after sons death,"Rileys mum and dad, Tuesday and Alex, recall his diagnosis coming as a huge, horrible shock, after what they thought would just be a simple infection. Around Christmas 2011, Mrs Roberts noticed Riley being wobbly on his feet. She said: I took him to the doctors expecting them to tell me he had an inner ear infection. But they sent me straight to Yeovil Hospital where scans and tests revealed just a few weeks later that Riley had a rare brain tumour. They told me that there was nothing they could do for him, and he would be unlikely to make his sixth birthday, she said. The couple were referred to CHSWs Charlton Farm Hospice, but were apprehensive. ""He was my son, my baby, and I wanted to care for him myself,"" said Mrs Roberts. Apprehensions subsided after the family, including their younger daughter Tallulah, first visited the care facility in March 2012. We stayed for a week, and it was amazing for us as a family,"" Mrs Roberts remembers. Over the following months the family were supported by Charlton Farm. ""Just knowing they were there at the end of the phone was such a comfort, she added. The support from the hospice continued even after the birth of their youngest daughter Eliza, who unfortunately could never meet her elder brother. We are still getting that support all these years on and when we return there it almost feels like we are going back home, added Mrs Roberts. The couple set up Team Riley in memory of their firstborn. She said: As a family, we feel passionately about raising money for the hospice. Having its support has been the best thing for us. ""The money we raise will help ensure this incredible service continues to be there for other families at a very difficult time in their lives, she added. Paul Hardwick, a family friend of the couple hopes to raise £2,000 for the hospice by participating in CHSWs Ride for Precious Lives. The event will see cyclists ride from Bristol to Cornwall from 12-14 July, visiting three hospice branches on their route. Seeing the support the charity offered the family I wanted to give something back and do something in Rileys memory,"" said Mr Hardwick. Riley left a lasting impression on all our lives. He was a very special little boy. He will be in my thoughts during every mile I cycle."" CHSW's area fundraiser, Kylie Gallagher, thanked the family, adding: Tuesday has helped us in all sorts of ways over the years, fundraising and encouraging others to, volunteering her time and speaking about her story to name a few.""

Pay-at-pump supermarket warning over fire death,"A man was able to set himself alight at a petrol station due to a lack of staff, a coroner has said. Afolabi Oluwafemi Ojerinde, 48, died after suffering major burns at a Tesco petrol station in Manchester on 5 September last year. Manchester coroner, Zak Golombeck, has warned supermarkets that more people could die if they did not take action. Mr Golombeck, in partnership with Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS), has sent a prevention of future deaths report to Tesco and other supermarkets. A spokesman for Tesco said: We have seen the report and are considering its findings. Mr Ojerinde used the petrol pump despite not having a car or an authorised container, and was allowed to proceed once payment had been made, without any additional checks through security cameras, the report said. Mr Golombeck said: ""There was no member of staff present at the petrol station to approve or deny the deceased access to the petrol pump, and his approval was automatic following payment made at the pump."" The inquest opened on 26 September last year and the final hearing is yet to take place. However, the coroner and GMFRS, said there was ""concern future deaths will occur"" if action was not taken. Tesco have until 20 August to respond to the report, which has also been sent to Sainsburys,  Asda, and WM Morrison supermarkets for guidance.

Performance group saved as student flats rejected,"Speaking to the committee, Nola Hersey, chair of the Dings Community Association, said: The proposed scheme incorporates a community space, a safer way to cross Kingsland Road, and importantly for many of our residents, access to an affordable supermarket. ""An industrial unit on this site will provide no obvious community benefit, but instead brings the risk of traffic pollution, noise and congestion. Preet Ahluwalia, principal director at Dominus, added: My father arrived in the UK as a refugee and he always appreciated the sanctuary that the UK gave him. So when he started our family business, he always sought to give back. ""Thats why we started the development by asking the community what they need most and incorporating that into our business plan. But planning officers said there would be an overall reduction of employment space, in part of the city where jobs should be protected. And the Invisible Circus warned that building student flats risked the citys reputation for fostering creativity. Kathryn Chiswell-Jones, from the Artspace Lifespace charity, said: The Invisible Circus is a key cultural institution in Bristol. ""Were concerned that more student accommodation at the expense of creative space risks eroding Bristols creative core. ""Losing Unit 15 means losing the capacity to develop specialist aerial acts, risking Bristols reputation as a circus city. The committee voted seven to two in favour of refusing planning permission.

Petition to protect 'eyesore' pub from vandalism,"Gillian Rodgers, chairman of South Hetton Parish Council, warned the building was a danger to residents. She said: ""Its dreadful - children were on the roof last week and our major concern is that it will take for someone to get seriously hurt before something is done about it."" Sheryl Elliot, who set up the petition, said the site ruined the area. ""It looks dreadful and dangerous, and is now a blot on the villages landscape,"" she said. The parish council urged the county council to prioritise the community campaign. It said the area had a ""thriving"" community centre, successful cricket club, ""flourishing"" businesses and excellent school, but the anti-social behaviour the former pub attracts was an ongoing cause for concern. Ms Rodgers said: ""Its frustrating, with all the good work weve done in the village, and the one thing that remains is that awful eyesore of a building."" The pub closed more than 15 years ago and was later bought at auction, but attempts to contact the owner have failed, reports the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Following the concerns, Durham County Council said it could force the buildings owners to improve the site. Stephen Reed, planning development manager, said: ""We are aware of local peoples concerns about the condition of this privately owned building and are investigating with a view to exercising powers [..] to require the owners to carry out a number of improvements.""

Pharmacist sold drugs without prescription,"Cullinan had further pleaded guilty earlier this year on behalf of his Castlereagh pharmacy and as director for failing to keep a register of drugs at the premises. Under legislation, drugs dispensed in community pharmacies are strictly controlled, and pharmacies are required to keep records of all supplies. The court heard these records must be updated on a daily basis or else it is a criminal offence. Although up to 32 co-codamol tablets can be purchased over the counter, any more must have a prescription. A pharmacy investigator conducted a routine inspection of Castlereagh Pharmacy on 15 January 2020 and found a number of discrepancies in relation to missing drug registers. He asked Cullinan to explain, but he was unable to do so. The investigator then made contact with some wholesale drug companies for records of supplies to the pharmacy. About six months later on 17 June, another officer visited the pharmacy and asked a member of staff for a box of 100 co-codamol tablets. The court heard the staff member turned to Cullinan, but he shook his head and said no. The member of staff said they were short of boxes of 100 tablets, and gave the officer a box of 32. But further investigations found at the time there were 11 boxes of 100 tablets, and one box of 90. Wholesale records also showed the pharmacy bought 3,085 boxes of 100 tablets between 1 January and 17 June 2020. Another review found there were no private sales, and subscriptions sent from the pharmacy to the Department of Health (DoH) found that 3,000 boxes were unaccounted for. The prosecution said the profit to Cullinan ""could have run into the tens of thousands of pounds"". Cullinan attended an interview under caution but made no comment to all questions. The offending continued over a three-and-a-half year period. The DoH referred the case to the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland, who placed interim conditions on Cullinan from 1 July 2020. The prosecution said after criminal proceedings had finished, the society would be holding a fitness to practice hearing. Cullinan's defence Kieran Mallon KC said there has been ""an avalanche of consequences"" for him, and there has been a ""significant impact"" on his reputation. ""There has been a complete and absolute fall from grace for this accused,"" Mr Mallon told the court. ""He is under absolutely no illusion of the shame he has brought on his family. ""His motivation was purely financial.'' Sentencing Cullinan on Friday, the judge described his offences as a ""serious breach of the high degree of trust placed on him as a registered pharmacist"". He added: ""Failing to keep a proper record undermines the trust essential for the operation of the community pharmacy system''. The judge said the motive was the desire for additional income for the pharmacy ""by operating outside the rules"". As well as the suspended sentence, the judge fined the company £8,000. Following the sentencing on Friday, Canice Ward, head of the DOH's medicines regulatory group said the conviction ""involved the blatant abuse of the privileged position of a pharmacist by diverting a large quantity of prescription medicines, thereby placing the public at risk."" He added: ""People can be assured that pharmacies in Northern Ireland are subject to regular Departmental inspection and compliance visits to ensure that they continue to operate safely and within the law."""

Pilots' union and Aer Lingus pay talks break down,"On Thursday afternoon, IALPA President Capt Mark Tighe confirmed at this point ""talks have broken down"". Capt Tighe said during Thursday's meeting the union had moved from its inflationary figure of almost 24%. However, he added: ""The company has not moved from its statement that anything more than 12.25% would have to be funded by pilots' own payments through work practice."" Donal Moriarty, Aer Lingus' chief corporate affairs officer, said the airline had ""engaged constructively"" in talks with the union. ""We tried to discuss items that could actually resolve this dispute, in particular we tried to discuss productivity, flexibility and the modernisation of our collective agreement,"" Mr Moriarty said. He added discussing these are ""essential"" for reaching a pay deal, but IALPA was unable to enter into these talks as it has ""no mandate to do so"". ""We advised IALPA and encouraged them to revisit that mandate in order to put within their power the normal aspect of pay negotiations,"" Mr Moriarty said. The total number of flights cancelled as a result of the industrial action, Aer Lingus said, is 270. All Aer Lingus UK regional flights, operated by Emerald Airlines, and Aer Lingus UK transatlantic flights to and from Manchester will operate as scheduled. Speaking on BBC News NI's Good Morning Ulster programme earlier on Thursday, Capt Tighe said ""nothing has changed"" and the union has been ""wanting and willing"" to meet. He explained that the 24% increase is a ""cumulative figure of inflation from 2019, our last pay rise. ""We've had this for 22 months, and until a deal is agreed and brought to the members, the point of agreement between the negotiators and the company, at that point in time the executives would look at stopping the action but until then there will be no stopping the action."" Capt Tighe added that an escalation of the action ""can't be ruled out"". He said: ""Our passengers are very important to us as pilots, our managers don't meet our passengers, we do every day, we interact with them, they're really important to us, we did not want it to come to this."" The number of flights cancelled ""beggars belief"", he said, as only a ""small percentage"" of pilots work outside of their contracted hours. ""The rest of us are tired, we need time to rest and time to spend with our families but the company are somehow saying that all of these flight cancellations are due to this tiny number of people who work on their days off. It beggars belief and it's not credible."" In a statement the airline said: ""Aer Lingus will continue to focus on minimising the disruption caused to customers by IALPAs industrial action."" The airline said it ""made it clear that it remains available for discussions both directly and through the states industrial relations framework. Aer Lingus called on IALPA to ""consider the damage that its continued industrial action is inflicting upon passengers, the company and the Irish economy. A full list of cancelled flights up to and including 2 July can be found on the airline's website. It said: ""The nature of this industrial action may lead to further cancellations and delays and we will communicate directly with impacted customers as soon as possible."" Co-pilots can start out at about 36,000 (£30,400), with packages increasing based on actual flying hours. Irish broadcaster RTÉ reports a captain at the top of the scale can be paid about 287,000 (£242,000). Capt Mark Tighe explained that this can take up to 26 years. There are differences for pilots depending on whether flights are short or long-haul. The airline has said passengers with flights booked between 26 June and 2 July have a number of options available. Each should be contacted via email or SMS, or through their travel agent. For customers who have booked directly with Aer Lingus, there is the option to change flights online. The company said it will waive the fare difference and any change fee if rebooking for a later date. There is also the option to request a full refund or a refund voucher, which can be redeemed within five years. Aer Lingus said passengers who booked through a travel agent or third party must contact those companies directly. ""Unfortunately, Aer Lingus is unable to assist directly in these cases,"" Aer Lingus outlines on its website."
"Plaid only party to put Wales first, says leader","On the campaign trail in north-west Wales, Mr ap Iorwerth said there was a ""clear and consistent"" message from his party. ""The Conservatives are going to lose this election heavily,"" he said. ""We know that Sir Keir will form the next government but we need MPs who will hold that new government to account,"" he said, adding Plaid Cymrus voice needed ""to be as strong as possible in the next parliament"". Meanwhile, David TC Davies, the Welsh Secretary and the most senior Conservative Westminster politician in Wales, has been out campaigning in the south-east corner of the country. In a message on X, he re-iterated the partys proposals to enact a law in Westminster to require ""local consent"" for 20mph zones and to give local communities a legal right to challenge existing zones. A Conservative government will legislate quickly to make sure that 20mph speed limits across England and Wales cannot be imposed without the support of local people in referendums, he said. Wales has had a 20mph speed limit in largely built-up areas since September last year. Introduced by the former first minister Mark Drakeford's government, the limit prompted the largest petition the Senedd has received. Changes have been promised by Vaughan Gething's government, but recent figures showed the number of people injured on 20 and 30mph roads fell by almost a third in the final quarter of 2023. Welsh Labour has told BBC Wales: ""Our volunteers and candidates are out campaigning every day to bring Labour's message of change to voters across Wales. Change can only happen if you vote for it on 4 July."" The number of Westminster seats in Wales will drop at this general election with the number of Welsh MPs cut from 40 to 32. The boundary commission announced last year several Welsh seats would vanish in their current form. With the exception of Ynys Môn, every Westminster constituency in Wales will see changes. At the 2019 general election, Labour won 22 seats, the Conservatives 14 and Plaid Cymru four."
"Plans approved for 'right size, right place' homes","According to planning documents, the proposed development would consist of six one-bedroom apartments, four two-bedroom semi detached houses, 12 three-bedroom properties and 17 four-bedroom houses.

Plans approved to replace crumbling pub with flats,"One objector told councillors community sentiment was against the proposal, and called for greater public consultation over the future of the site. The objector also said the proposed flats were out of character for the area and too tall. Councillor Bob Piper said the former pub needed demolishing sooner rather than later. If we dont demolish it soon, it will fall down of its own accord, he told the planning committee at the meeting on Wednesday. The local authority previously approved an application by Sir Harry's Properties to demolish the building in March 2022 but the work was never carried out. Planning officers said the latest proposals would bring benefits to the area, adding that housing was much-needed there. They said the pub had been an eyesore and been the subject of numerous complaints. Before its forced closure, the pub on the corner of Lewisham Road and Halfords Lane was known as a popular venue for West Bromwich Albion supporters due to it being only a short walk from the clubs home ground.

"Plans for battery storage to power 162,000 homes","Net Zero Seventeen said the proposed development would store enough electricity to power about 161,897 homes for two hours. The 7.4-hectare (18.3-acre) site would be operational for 40 years, after which time it would be decommissioned and equipment removed from the land. The company said schemes relevant to the one it was proposing had already been approved in the area in recent years, including a solar farm to the north-east of the site in 2014, Westnewton Wind Farm in 2011 and five battery storage facilities in the Carlisle area, all approved between 2017 and 2024. In documents submitted to the council's planning department, the company explained the increase in interest associated with battery storage facilities in the area.

Plans for year-round use of caravan park rejected,"Currently, the caravan park cannot be occupied from 15 January and 1 March due to planning restrictions, reports the Local Democracy Reporting service.

Plans to boost resilience of 999 system announced,"A nationwide technical issue meant calls were not connected to emergency services in June 2023. The government will increase its oversight of any future incidents and improve communications between emergency services. BT, which manages the system, says it ""fell short of its own high standards."" Ofcom is investigating the telecoms firm, which took responsibility for the fault, with the outcome expected in the coming months. ""The level of disruption to the service on Sunday 25 June 2023 has never been seen before and we are sincerely sorry for the distress caused,"" said BT security boss Howard Watson. ""As outlined in the Government's Post-Incident Review, we have put in place a comprehensive improvement plan to prevent this series of events reoccurring."" To improve its oversight of similar events in the future, the government will identify who is responsible and accountable for the 999 system in the face of different threats, such as cyber attacks and natural disasters. And it will identify a way to advise the public on what to do so people can contact emergency services if the 999 system becomes inaccessible across the UK. It said the plans would be in place by the end of April 2024. ""We are determined to prevent history from repeating itself, with public safety being absolutely paramount,"" said Technology minister Michelle Donelan. ""This is why, following a thorough review of the incident, we are working with BT to establish enhanced resilience measures, ensuring the UK is always prepared to effectively address major emergencies."" While the outage affected various emergency services in different parts of the country, there are no confirmed cases of serious harm which have been connected to it."

The national park authority ruled on 26 March it could not determine the application for several reasons. These included the fact the reopened quarry would move beyond the old site boundaries and would require modern planning permission. Mr Roberts said the abandoned quarry had several pools which were home to large numbers of great crested newts.

Politician suspended for 'different number plates',"Guido Fawkes reported that Ms Passmore was ""spotted driving out of the Welsh Parliament's car park with her number plate hanging off, revealing a different one underneath"". A Labour spokesman said: ""The Labour party takes the conduct of our elected representatives extremely seriously and all complaints are investigated in accordance with the party's complaints procedure."" South Wales Police said: ""It appears that the adhesive tape which secures the number plate to the car has become ineffective and the number plate has fallen off. ""The car remains on private property and as such, no offence has been identified. The owner of the car is aware of the matter."" Ms Passmore has represented Islwyn in Cardiff Bay since 2016. Her suspension leaves the Labour party in the Senedd with only 29 of the 60 seats. In 2018, the Labour politician was suspended from what was then the Welsh assembly for two weeks for failing to take a breath test. She was banned from driving by Newport magistrates on 12 February 2018, after admitting failing to provide a specimen for analysis. The assembly standards committee recommendation to exclude her for 14 days was accepted without objections in the Senedd chamber. She apologised at the time, referring to ""private struggles that I have found difficult to master"". Ms Passmore said that on the day of her arrest she had tried to drive from Cardiff to her mother's house after drinking three glasses of wine. She said she suffered an asthma attack and took a high dose of medication, prednisone. Her car broke down in the St Mellons area of the city and while she was waiting for the breakdown service, the police arrived and asked her to provide a breath sample. A standards committee report said she tried twice but was unable to do so. Ms Passmore said she did not deliberately fail to give a sample and was distressed after not being able to use her asthma medication properly. The DVLA, which regulates vehicle registration numbers, says number plates ""must be correctly displayed"" and it is an offence to ""alter, rearrange or misrepresent the numbers and letters"". Anyone doing so could face a fine of up to £1,000."

Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk A friend of a man who was stabbed to death outside a shopping centre has told the BBC's Question Time young people need to be taught the difference between right and wrong. Steven Rose asked the panel, in Birmingham, what they would do to tackle knife crime and disagreed with suggestions socio-economic problems had caused its rise. He described his friend Tom Ellis as ""a lovely lad, a gentle giant"" and said Mr Ellis and his partner had been saving up for a house at the time he was stabbed to death. A 16-year-old boy accused of Mr Ellis's murder has been remanded in custody to appear at Warwick Crown Court on 12 July. Mr Ellis died after being attacked outside the Ropewalk shopping centre in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, on 8 June. Mr Rose said he first met him when he joined the local squash club and he ""just fitted in straight away"". He added: ""He had a partner, they used to come up to the squash club and have a social drink on a Friday night, probably because it was a nice easy, safe place to go and have a drink I suppose."" Mr Rose said his friend had been ""loving life"" and then ""in the blink of an eye, gone"". Responding to his question Yvette Cooper, for Labour, said there needed to be a ""comprehensive"" solution that included more police officers on the streets, and ""proper consequences for carrying knives"". She also called for a move to stop knives being bought online and an effort to ""crack down on criminal gangs that are dragging young people into crime"". She said her party had a ""mission for the country to halve knife crime over the next 10 years"". Andrew Mitchell, for the Conservatives, said his government had ""substantially"" increased sentences for carrying knives. He supported the use of stop and search, if used ""more sensitively"" and said there could be more use of technology and efforts to restrict the availability of knives. ""A lot more we can do within schools, making it clear to students they must never carry knives,"" he added. The Liberal Democrats' Layla Moran said it was necessary to have ""police who are embedded in their communities, who know these kids from a young age"" and called stop and search a ""waste of time"". She said prevention was the key and added: ""When you've got children and families in poverty, that is one of the causes of high areas of knife crime.""

Poll shows growing concern over Biden's age after debate,"With concerns growing, the president's campaign surrogates appeared on a series of politics shows in the US on Sunday morning. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, a close ally of the president and a campaign co-chair, fiercely defended the president on ABC News' This Week. Joe Biden has an incredible record, and he knows, as the American people do, that when you get knocked down, you get back up and you fight harder,"" the senator said. ""Thats what hes planning to do. When Mr Coons was asked about the president's mental fitness, he deflected and raised concerns about Trump. He also would not say whether Mr Biden was listening to the growing concerns about his age and stability. ""He's the only Democrat who can beat Donald Trump,"" Mr Coons said about the president. Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock said on NBC News Meet the Press that the president should ""absolutely not"" drop out of the race. ""There have been more than a few Sundays when I wished I preached a better sermon"" Mr Warnock, who is also a pastor, said. ""But after the sermon was over, it was my job to embody the message, to show up for the people that I serve. And that's what Joe Biden has been doing."" Meanwhile, Republicans doubled-down on their critiques of the president's performance saying it showed why Trump was the right choice. ""Joe Biden had a disastrous performance, which is why they're talking about replacing him,"" Republican Senator JD Vance said on Fox News on Sunday. Mr Vance said Trump was engaging, funny and had a ""good natured demeanour"" during the debate. ""That's what you need to be able to serve as president of the United States and to contrast with Joe Biden, who seemed to be unable to complete a sentence,"" he said. A new poll shows that some Democratic voters are deeply concerned about whether Joe Biden is mentally fit to serve as president after a shaky debate performance on Thursday. A CBS News Youth Gov poll released on Sunday found that 72% of registered voters believe the president does not have the mental and cognitive health to serve as president - a sharp increase from the 65% who said the same in an earlier CBS News poll. Forty-nine percent of voters say the same of former President Donald Trump. Particularly alarming for the Biden campaign, 45% of registered Democrats who responded to the poll believe the president should step aside for another candidate. Concerns about the candidates' age - Mr Biden's is 81 and Trump is 78 - existed before Thursday's debate. Mr Biden's hoarse voice and muddled answers, however, renewed concerns among some Democrats about his candidacy and left some calling for Mr Biden to step aside. In the days since the debate, first lady Jill Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Barack Obama have acknowledged it was not Mr Biden's best performance. But they and many other Democratic allies rejected calls that Mr Biden should step aside. The CBS poll contrasts with a memo shared by Biden campaign chairwoman Jen OMalley on Saturday. It claims that internal polling shows that it is the ""beltway class"" counting Mr Biden out, not Americans across the country. But interviews with voters after the debate, back up the concern expressed in CBS News' poll. Voters told BBC News they were worried about the president after his performance. ""I am less confident in the ability of Biden to lead this country today than I ever have been,"" one Democratic voter told the BBC after the debate. With concerns growing, the president's campaign surrogates appeared on a series of politics shows in the US on Sunday morning. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, a close ally of the president and a campaign co-chair, fiercely defended the president on ABC News' This Week. Joe Biden has an incredible record, and he knows, as the American people do, that when you get knocked down, you get back up and you fight harder,"" the senator said.

Pool shut for six months coming 'back with a splash',"Ricky Whiting, the new general manager of the pool, said he was ""thrilled"" for the reopening which would operate under the trading name of Better. ""Better is committed to delivering a first-class service and we aim to please the people of Bedford and beyond."" The company said it had restored key water features, and the ""leisure pool, flumes, indoor lazy river, small pool and jacuzzi will all be available for your community to enjoy"". A gym area has also been converted into a dedicated party room and new caterers will be on the site. ""There will still be some future investment, this includes essential maintenance work on the outdoor elements of the centre and continued work to transform the remaining previous gym areas into party room areas,"" a GLL spokesperson said. Conservative councillor Sarah Gallagher, portfolio holder for leisure and culture, said: ""It goes beyond mere cosmetic upgrades, although the fresh coat of paint has already made a significant impact.

"Post Office sabotaged Horizon probe, says investigator","In 2012, under pressure from MPs, the Post Office commissioned a report from Second Sight to look into claims from sub-postmasters that Horizon had been to blame for shortfalls in their accounts, rather than criminality. Mr Henderson and his colleague Ron Warmington began investigating various cases but were sacked by the Post Office in March 2015. In a statement to the inquiry into the scandal, Mr Henderson said that rather than being interested in getting to the truth of what happened, the Post Office had tried to obstruct Second Sight's efforts. ""Requests for documents were either ignored or responses were excessively delayed,"" he wrote. ""Unjustified claims of legal professional privilege were used to justify withholding documents from us."" As part of the probe, Second Sight asked for documents relating to prosecution cases to be collated. Mr Henderson said that ""within days"" of being provided with the available documents in late October 2012, ""we realised that we may be looking at a significant number of miscarriages of justice"". However, he said that Ms Vennells, who was Post Office chief executive at the time,  ""frequently and consistently attempted to steer Second Sight away from investigating potential miscarriages of justice"". By February 2015, Mr Henderson said he ""felt we were dealing with a cover-up"" by the Post Office ""and possibly a criminal conspiracy"". At the time he was concerned the Post Office would take him to court for alleged breaches of confidentiality and a non-disclosure agreement. His partner Mr Warmington said it became clear that the Post Office was ""aware, possibly at the highest levels"" that the Horizon system had ""for years been producing spurious discrepancies in branch accounts"". He also said the Post Office ""had been responsible for numerous unsafe prosecutions, convictions, custodial sentences, bankruptcies and even suicides"" due to the ""improper behaviour"" of its prosecutors. The investigators wrote an interim report into the Horizon system, published in July 2013, which identified bugs that could have made Horizon convictions unsafe. Following this report the Post Office, along with Second Sight and campaigners led by former sub-postmaster Alan Bates, set up a mediation scheme in August 2013. The Post Office closed this scheme in March 2015. Mr Henderson said that towards the end of the scheme ""some questions asked 12 months earlier had still not been answered"". ""Protecting 'the brand' was the priority, not supporting sub-postmasters,"" he said. He added that many aspects of the individual cases that were prosecuted ""just didn't make sense"". ""For example, in none of the cases that we looked at did we find any evidence of personal gain or benefit,"" he said. ""This may indicate that the alleged loss was not real and was more likely to have been caused by a faulty computer system."" The Post Office did extensive vetting of sub-postmasters before taking them on, he added, but ""would have us believe that significant numbers... had suddenly become career criminals. I found this implausible."" Mr Henderson added that at one point the Post Office had more people working in its public relations department than its legal department, which appeared an ""inappropriate"" and ""unsustainable"" priority for the business. The Post Office was ""constantly sabotaging"" the work of independent investigators probing issues with the Horizon IT system, an inquiry has heard. Forensic accountant Ian Henderson said the Post Office unjustifiably withheld documents from his company, Second Sight, which was brought in to investigate the accounting software in 2012. He said protecting the Post Office brand was the priority, rather than supporting sub-postmasters. Mr Henderson added that former Post Office boss Paula Vennells tried to steer investigators away from looking into potential miscarriages of justice. Between 1999 and 2015 the Post Office prosecuted hundreds of sub-postmasters for offences such as theft and fraud on the basis of faulty accounting data from the Horizon IT system. nan In 2012, under pressure from MPs, the Post Office commissioned a report from Second Sight to look into claims from sub-postmasters that Horizon had been to blame for shortfalls in their accounts, rather than criminality.

Post Office sorry after sub-postmaster data leak,"It comes as witnesses continue to give evidence at an inquiry into the scandal, which saw hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted for theft between 1999 and 2015 when incorrect information from Horizon accounting software made it look like money was missing from their branches. Other sub-postmasters which were not prosecuted were pursued by the Post Office over alleged losses in accounts. The data breach on Wednesday was first reported by the Daily Mail and led to an angry response from former sub-postmasters. Former sub-postmaster Christopher Head tweeted the text of a letter he had written to Mr Read and Post Office chair Nigel Railton. He wrote: ""As you can imagine this has caused a great amount of upset, distress and anger amongst those whose data is now within the public domain."" Many sub-postmasters who ""hadn't shared details with their own families"" and others who were ""extremely traumatised by this whole scandal even today"" had been hit by the breach, Mr Head wrote. He later told the BBC that many sub-postmasters were suffering from post-traumatic stress and ""trying their best to move on"". ""The problem is that we are getting new scandals within a scandal and new revelations on an almost daily or weekly basis that is preventing people from trying to heal,"" he added. In response to Mr Head's letter, Mr Read said: ""This is a truly terrible error and one for which at this stage I can only apologise."" The Post Office is ""reviewing with urgency the right follow-up actions to take"" for those people who have been affected by the breach, he added, and how to correct the organisation's processes. nan One former sub-postmaster told the Daily Mail she was incandescent. Wendy Buffrey said that the action could ""destroy lives"" because criminals could now target sub-postmasters who had received compensation. Ron Warmington, the forensic investigator whose firm Second Sight was brought in to probe the Horizon system in 2013, told the Mail it was an extraordinary breach of confidentiality and another example of Post Office incompetence. The leaked document contained the names of 555 former subpostmasters who sued the Post Office in 2017. In 2019, the firm agreed to pay them £58m in compensation, but much of the money went on legal fees. In a statement the Post Office said the document had been removed from its website. It said: We are investigating as an urgent priority how it came to be published. We are in the process of notifying the Information Commissioners Office (ICO) of the incident, in line with our regulatory requirements. An ICO spokesman said: Post Office Limited have made us aware of an incident and we are assessing the information provided."" Organisations need tell the watchdog about a data breach within 72 hours of becoming aware of it, if it poses ""a risk to peoples rights and freedoms"". More than 900 sub-postmasters were prosecuted for stealing because of incorrect information from Horizon in what has been called the UK's most widespread miscarriage of justice. Many sub-postmasters went to prison for false accounting and theft, and many were financially ruined. The Post Office has apologised after it published the names and addresses of 555 postmasters it pursued during the Horizon scandal. The company confirmed personal details had been shared in a document on its website and said it had referred itself to data watchdog the Information Commissioners Office. One former sub-postmaster said the breach had caused ""upset, distress and anger"" and added the data leak was ""preventing people from trying to heal"".

"Post Office system not a scandal, insists ex-union boss","Mr Thomson said that the number of sub-postmasters who had been prosecuted was a ""tiny percentage"" of the 100,000 people who have used Horizon over 25 years. Horizon is a software system for tasks such as accounting and stocktaking which began to be installed across Post Office branches from 1999. Sub-postmasters complained about bugs after it falsely reported shortfalls - often for many thousands of pounds - but their concerns were dismissed. Mr Thomson said the Post Office's ""mishandling of the situation"" has been ""so catastrophic"" for sub-postmasters, the brand and Royal Mail group. It means that the Post Office has ""not been able to defend a robust Horizon computer system"", Mr Thomson said. Mr Thomson denied, however, the association that it became ""too close"" to the Post Office or was ""flush with cash"". The inquiry also heard the former union general secretary privately tipped off the Post Office about those ""sniffing around"" the Horizon IT system. In an email from Mark Davies, communications and corporate affairs director at the Post Office, sent on May 10 2015, part of the chain read: ""Our media relationships with George [Thomson] and team are very good at present - he has been tipping us off, privately, about people sniffing around Horizon."" Asked by inquiry counsel Mr Blake if he was ""tipping off"" the Post Office, Mr Thomson said: I have made the point time after time today that Horizon is a robust system, adding that he worked closely with the Post Office to strengthen the franchise. Mr Head said: I think his evidence so far shows him for the man that he is. He has shown no remorse, no sympathy, there is absolutely no sign of any apology for his or the NFSP's part in the scandal and the damage done in this scandal. ""The testimony so far is nothing short of abhorrent."" The NFSP was a trade union - set up in 1897 by a group of sub-postmasters to help their profession - which was changed into a trade association a decade ago after the Post Office did not recognise the group for collective bargaining purposes. During questioning at the inquiry on Friday, Mr Thomson's responses were greeted by astonishment and anger by some sub-postmasters in the room. When asked by Julian Blake, counsel for the inquiry, why the NFSP had not defended sub-postmasters, Mr Thomson insisted that the federation had argued on their behalf but had not had the funds for a legal defence. The NFSP has received millions of pounds in payments from the Post Office. The inquiry was shown an email from August 2013 that outlined plans for a 15- year deal between the Post Office and NFSP. It included annual payments starting at £500,000 in 2013-14 and reaching £2.5m between 2017 and 2028. Mr Thomson was general secretary of the NFSP between 2007 and 2018. He said: ""We worked closely with the Post Office because we both needed to have a successful franchise - that's the reality."" Following Mr Thomson's evidence to the inquiry, Calum Greenhow, chief executive of the NFSP sought to distance the organisation from his comments, saying the union was ""shocked"". ""We want to apologise unreservedly to any member who sought help from the NFSP about Horizon and didnt receive the support they so desperately needed and deserved,"" he added. ""It is clear that more could and should have been done for them and for others."" Mr Greenhow said the evidence heard on Friday ""showed"" that during Mr Thomsons tenure ""he did not take seriously enough the significant warning signals about Horizon and was not willing to accept challenges to his views on it"". The Horizon scandal was thrown back into the spotlight by an ITV drama broadcast at the beginning of the year: Mr Bates vs the Post Office. It followed the story of Alan Bates, a former sub-postmaster and campaigner who took the Post Office to court, and a number of sub-postmasters who were wrongly accused of stealing money or falsifying records. He has led a 20-year campaign for justice for sub-postmasters, and was knighted this month. Mr Thomson criticised Sir Alan and the media for painting Horizon as not fit for purpose. ""This viewpoint is not only factually incorrect but has damaged the brand and post offices all over the UK, he said. ""My support for Horizon has never wavered."" He said although bugs had been found in the software, that did not mean Horizon was not systemically robust. He added that he was ""furious"" with the Post Office for taking people to court when they knew ""people could access your computer"", adding that the ""shenanigans"" were ""bizarre"". Former sub-postmaster Nitin Pandit said the Post Ofice and the NFSP had ""just one standard response: that the system is robust."" He said himself and former colleagues ""are all very angry"". ""Even today we are sitting in the inquiry and so many of us are absolutely fuming,"" he said. ""NFSP were not supposed to work hand in hand with the Post Office, they were supposed to protect us,"" he added. ""Where were they?"" The Post Office's Horizon system is ""very robust"" and the only scandal is that the company failed to properly defend it, according to a man tasked with representing sub-postmasters. George Thomson, the former leader of the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters (NFSP), told a long-running inquiry: ""The Horizon system is not the scandal, the Post Office stupidity on steroids handling of the situation is the scandal."" Between 1999 and 2015, more than 900 sub-postmasters were prosecuted for offences including theft on the strength of faulty data from the Horizon IT system. Christopher Head, a former sub-postmaster, described Mr Thomson's views as ""nothing short of abhorrent"". David Enright, a lawyer who has represented hundreds of people in connection with the Post Office, said Mr Thomson's ""flat earther defence of the Horizon computer system defies credulity"".

He added that he was ""furious"" with the Post Office for taking people to court when they knew ""people could access your computer"", adding that the ""shenanigans"" were ""bizarre"". Former sub-postmaster Nitin Pandit said the Post Ofice and the NFSP had ""just one standard response: that the system is robust."" He said himself and former colleagues ""are all very angry"".

""NFSP were not supposed to work hand in hand with the Post Office, they were supposed to protect us,"" he added. ""Where were they?"""
Postal delays leave Scottish holidaymakers unable to vote,"The UK deadline to apply for a postal vote was 19 June. Anyone who is a long-term postal voter or who applied before 7 June ought to have received their voting pack last week. Others who applied after this date could expect to be part of a second dispatch of forms. However, this has not been widely advertised and has caused confusion to some voters who have seen friends or family with ballot papers already. Voting packs are all due to arrive by Saturday but with the school holidays now underway in parts of Scotland some families could be out of the country by then. Hannah Hellis from Rutherglen received her postal vote before flying off for a family holiday but her husband Kristian did not. Kristian told BBC Scotland news he registered to vote about two weeks ago and was told his paperwork would arrive within a week. But as the family flew off to Italy for two-and-a-half weeks on Thursday, the ballot had still not arrived. ""Its disappointing to be missing out, especially at this election,"" he said. ""I think announcing the election at the start of the Scottish school holidays disadvantages a lot of people here and its a shame because this feels like a big election with everything thats going on. ""Ive got a funny feeling my voting paperwork will arrive today after Ive left."" Karry Bicket from Troon said she is ""disappointed"" that she will miss the chance to vote due to her pack not arriving before her holiday. ""Weve received nothing, my husbands not received his either. ""I did think that was odd given its a week today but weve not received anything so we cant vote,"" she said. She flew to the Dominican Republic on Thursday, and will arrive back in Scotland next Friday, after the polls close. Other said they had no issues, with voting packs arriving over the last few days. Lisa McColligan from Gartcosh in North Lanarkshire said she had no problems registering to use a postal vote for the first time. ""Ours came through pretty much straight away. We were quite surprised because we were worried because of when the election was announced, we knew we didnt have a lot of time,"" she said on her way to Florida for a family wedding. ""We did it differently this time because we knew wed be out of the country. We registered a few weeks ago, made sure we had our postal vote, so its all done."" Royal Mail said it had investigated concerns over the delivery of postal votes in some areas but had found no issues with backlogs. A spokesperson said: ""We understand there have been issues associated with the printing of ballot packs that has delayed them being handed over to us for delivery. ""We are delivering ballot packs as soon as they arrive in our network. We are working with all local authorities to get postal votes to voters as quickly as possible. The Electoral Commission said local authorities were working to get ballot forms out to postal voters ""as quickly as possible"". A spokesperson said: Anyone who applied before the deadline on Wednesday 19 June and had their application approved should soon receive their ballot pack through the post. ""Some people may have received these already."" On the campaign trail in Edinburgh, First Minister John Swinney said he was concerned about the reports and said the issue was right at the door of Prime Minster Rishi Sunak for calling an election during the Scottish school holidays. In East Lothian, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told BBC Scotland News said he had been told on doorsteps that people were still waiting to receive their postal ballots and that it was of serious concern. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, campaigning in Kirkcaldy, said it was deeply frustrating for those affected and called for the electoral authorities and the Royal Mail get this sorted ASAP. Scottish Liberal Democrat Wendy Chamberlain said several people had brought up the issue with her while she had been campaigning, adding: It does appear that some people will miss out on voting as a result."
Power cuts and travel disrupted as Storm Isha hits,"Yorkshire appeared to have escaped the worst of Storm Isha, despite overnight gusts of up to 75mph (121km/h). However, disruption to traffic and travel was reported on Monday morning, with train and plane services affected. In North Yorkshire, more than 1,000 properties remained affected by power cuts at lunchtime. A number of bridges and roads also remained closed in the county, including Tadcaster Bridge and the A684 between Hawes and Appersett. North Yorkshire Council said: ""During adverse weather conditions it is an ever-changing situation on our roads. ""Please respect road closure signs and do not drive through flood water."" Train operators LNER, Northern and TransPennine Express (TPE) all reported some services had been affected by the weather, according to National Rail. TPE urged customers not to travel until at least midday on Monday. Northern Powergrid said more than 600 properties were affected by power cuts in the Pickering area, with 200 properties affected in Filey and hundreds of other properties in the Dales still without supplies. A spokesperson said: We currently have around 1,100 customers off supply in the North Yorkshire county area. Our teams are assessing the damage from Storm Isha and coordinating the necessary repairs where conditions permit. We thank our customers for their patience and understanding while our teams work in challenging conditions to restore their power as soon as possible."" In the Yorkshire Dales, around 100 homes in the Aygsarth area were without electricity on Monday morning. Northern Powergrid said its crews were dealing with a ""major power cut in this area"". The company added it was ""working towards restoring"" power as ""early as possible"". Meanwhile, five people were rescued by fire crews after their cars became trapped in flood water on Monday in North Yorkshire. Four vehicles got stuck on the A684 between Leeming Bar and Northallerton at Morton on Swale, with emergency services called at around 05:00 GMT. In Hawes, fire crews were temporarily stranded when a tree fell across a road close to the town's fire station on Sunday night. Writing on Facebook, officers said the tree was later sawn up, allowing them to respond to emergency calls later in the evening. In Poppleton, near York, a 70ft (21m) tree was felled by high winds on Monday morning, blocking the main route through the village. City of York Council announced on X, formerly Twitter, that the city walls were closed on Monday due to high winds. The Met Office's yellow weather warning ended on Monday at 12:00 GMT. A separate yellow weather warning is in place for the whole of the region from Tuesday at 16:00 GMT to 12:00 GMT on Wednesday. Storm Isha brought damaging winds and widespread warnings to the country on Sunday night, with some parts of northern England recording their highest wind gusts since 2002. Here in Yorkshire, gusts peaked in the early hours of Monday morning, as forecast, with 76mph (122 km/h) recorded at Loftus and 75mph (121km/h) at Emley Moor near Huddersfield. Storm Isha is our ninth named storm of the season and the earliest we have reached the letter ""I"" since we started naming storms in 2015, following a particularly wet and windy autumn and winter. The winds will steadily moderate throughout Monday as Storm Isha pulls away into the Norwegian Sea. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

Pregnant mum finds partner dead on day of birth,"A pregnant mother due to go into hospital for a planned Caesarean section tried to wake her partner on the day of the birth only to realise he was dead. Thomas Gibson, 40, suffered a cardiac arrest while sleeping on the couch after a hospital doctor ""misinterpreted"" a scan 11 days earlier, an inquest at Stockport Coroner's Court heard. His partner, Rebecca Moss, shed tears as she described telling Mr Gibson to ""wake up, it's baby day"" but found he was ""cold and stiff"" when she tried to touch him. Ms Moss, from Stretford, Greater Manchester, had to give birth to their daughter, Harper, just hours later on 7 June, 2023. She told the court Mr Gibson was sleeping on the couch when she woke up at about 05:15 BST and realised he was not breathing. She said she called 999 and was told to get her partner onto the floor and begin chest compressions, which she did. Ms Moss told the court: ""The shock, trauma and not to mention the physical exertion of having to pull Tom off the couch and perform chest compressions at 39 weeks pregnant was overwhelming."" She described her partner as ""caring, charming and funny"" and said he was excited at becoming a father, spending every weekend building furniture for their baby. ""We say goodnight to his picture every night before bed and she has a quilt which has been made from his favourite jumpers,"" she said. ""Tom will live on through his daughter but that doesn't change the fact that he should still be here with us today."" The inquest heard Mr Gibson attended Wythenshawe Hospital A&E on 27 May, 2023 having suffered from a severe stomach bug for about three weeks. An electrocardiogram (ECG) was carried out and was escalated to Dr Thomas Bull by a junior doctor who recognised a potential blockage. Dr Bull, giving evidence, said he recognised there were signs of an abnormality on the ECG but at the time he did not think it was clinically ""significant"" without other heart symptoms. Mr Gibson was discharged and advised to come back if his stomach bug did not clear up. It later emerged the ECG showed signs of a ""complete heart block"" which can lead to sudden cardiac death. Dr Bull told the inquest: ""I can see now, in retrospect and in hindsight, there is abnormalities over and above those I could see present."" Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust has made a full admission of liability that it provided negligent medical care, according to lawyers for Mr Gibson's family. Dr Matthew Thornber, a consultant at the hospital, said the condition required ""nuance and experience"" to diagnose. The inquest continues.

Pride in London: Five things you might not know,nan
Primary school pupils protest against speed limit,"Students from the school have described the road as  ""narrow"" and ""quite scary"" at the moment. They added they thought it would give pupils more independence if the speed limit was lowered as parents would feel more confident to allow their children to walk to and from school on their own. Beccy Spicer, deputy headteacher of Stoborough Primary School, said: ""A lot of our families are feeling that it is too unsafe to walk to school, which is a shame because we want to promote walking to school. ""Not only for health and wellbeing but also because our children are very protective of the environment and would like to walk and not use a car because that's going to help with climate change, they're very passionate about this."" She added: ""We just feel, as a community in Stoborough, there's no need for it to be 40 when it is 30 either side."" Ms Spicer said the idea for the protest came from the students who raised the issues. ""There's a lot of learning involved - they've written letters, they've done some data handling and surveys, but also it's really important to get our young children heard,"" she said. ""They are the future."" Follow BBC South on Facebook, X (Twitter), or Instagram. Send your story ideas to south.newsonline@bbc.co.uk or via WhatsApp on 0808 100 2240."
Prince Harry can appeal against UK security ruling,"The decision to downgrade his security in February 2020 was taken by the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (Ravec)  which has delegated responsibility from the Home Office over the provision of security arrangements for members of the Royal Family. In a judgment this February, retired High Court judge Sir Peter Lane rejected the duke's case and concluded Ravec's approach was not irrational nor procedurally unfair. In his 52-page ruling, he noted that Ravec's decision was legally sound. After the ruling, a legal spokesman for the prince said he intended to appeal, adding: The duke is not asking for preferential treatment, but for a fair and lawful application of Ravecs own rules, ensuring that he receives the same consideration as others in accordance with Ravecs own written policy. Prince Harry now has the green light to challenge Sir Peter's dismissal at the Court of Appeal, according to an order by Lord Justice Bean dated May 23. Like other senior royals, Prince Harry and Meghan had received publicly-funded security protection before they stepped back from royal duties and moved to the US state of California. His case against the government is one of a series of legal challenges the prince has brought to the court, including high-profile lawsuits against parts of the British press."
Prince Harry remembers pain of bereavement,"Prince Harry, an ambassador for the charity who has helped at its children's events, even dressing up as Father Christmas, then describes how difficult talking about feelings of loss can be. Thats the hardest thing, especially for kids, which is, I dont want to talk about it because it will make me sad,"" he says. ""But once realising that if I do talk about it, and Im celebrating their life, then actually, things become easier, as opposed to this, I am just not going to talk about it and thats best form of coping, when in fact its not."" said the prince. ""If you suppress this for too long, you cannot suppress it for ever, it is not sustainable and it will eat away at you inside."" The prince also highlights how distressing it can be for people reluctant to talk about their feelings of grief. ""Especially when every defence mechanism in your mind and nervous system and everything else is saying, Do not go there,'"" he says. He praises Mrs Scott's efforts in supporting other families in such difficult moments, with the charity aiming to help 1,000 young people each year. And at the end of the conversation, she says: ""I feel the need to give you a hug,"" to which the prince replies: ""Let's do it."""
Princess Anne leaves hospital after treatment for injury,"Princess Anne left Southmead Hospital earlier on Friday morning without being seen publicly. She has returned to her country home at Gatcombe Park near Minchinhampton. The princess, King Charles III's sister, was injured on Sunday evening when she was out walking on her estate with horses nearby. But because of her concussion, the exact cause of the head wound remains unknown. According to the NHS, concussion can be the result of a ""temporary injury to the brain caused by a bump, blow or jolt"". The incident is the latest health problem to face a member of the Royal Family. King Charles and the Princess of Wales both have had a cancer diagnosis this year, limiting their public engagements. Princess Anne, known as one of the most hard-working royals, has carried out numerous public engagements in their absence. She had been due to take part in this week's state visit by Emperor Naruhito and Empress Masako of Japan. Other engagements were also scheduled in Scotland, Hampshire and Gloucestershire. Her husband and daughter Zara Tindall visited her bedside separately during her stay in hospital. ""I would like to extend my warmest thanks to all the team at Southmead Hospital for their care, expertise and kindness during my wife's short stay,"" Sir Tim said after her return home."
Prison staff's 'health worries over radon',"They said: ""We continue to engage closely with the Health and Safety Executive and we will regularly review the situation."" Radon is an odourless radioactive gas formed by decaying uranium found in rocks and soils. It is recognised to be a leading cause of lung cancer in the UK. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) started its investigation in December, the same month in which the first inmates were moved from the prison. More than 300 prisoners and former inmates are understood to have sought legal counsel over their potential exposure to radon. Sarah Rigby, South West representative for the Prison Officers' Association (POA), said ""several"" of the 126 staff they represented at Dartmoor had approached the union. ""The vast majority of our members are concerned about the radon being at Dartmoor,"" she said. Ms Rigby said: ""They're obviously worried about any future health connotations that this might have, it's something they potentially won't know for 10, 20, 30 years."" ""They're watching prisoners be transferred out but they're still working there on a daily basis - you can understand why they are worried,"" she said. ""There's nothing they can do to protect themselves."" Ms Rigby said: ""They feel that the prison and prison service aren't doing enough to address their concerns and that things aren't moving quickly enough."" The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said it had kept staff and unions updated. Ms Rigby said as of 14 June, 138 prisoners remained at HMP Dartmoor - less than a quarter of its 640-space capacity. MoJ figures show there were 677 prisoners at Dartmoor in November 2023, reducing to 243 in May 2024, the most recent official figures available. According to the MoJ, as of 21 June, there were 87,395 prisoners across the UK, against a useable capacity of 88,778. Ms Rigby said there were enough spaces nationwide to last ""about another three weeks"". ""Its no great secret that prisons are suffering with overcrowding and could do with spaces at Dartmoor but the reality is if the HSE says we can't use them, we can't use them."" Radon is measured in becquerels per cubic metre of air (bq/m3). The average level in UK homes is 20 bq/m3, according to the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Agency guidance cites levels may be higher in parts of the country rich in granite, such as Dartmoor in Devon and across areas of Cornwall. The Ionising Radiation Regulations 2017 require that action be taken when levels reach 300bq/m3. However, the limit for ""domestic settings"" is 200bq/m3, the Radon Association said. In 2020, the average annual radon level peaked at 2,988bq/m3 in one area of the prison, according to one of the measuring devices distributed throughout the building - the FOI response said. It is understood readings in 2020 were taken in ""non-accommodation areas"". Meanwhile, in 2023 ""within A wing cellular accommodation"" the highest recorded level, seasonally adjusted to calculate the annual average, was 3,123 bq m-3. These were peak levels in certain areas, while readings across the prison varied widely. In 2020, levels dropped as low as five bq m-3 in one area of the prison, according to one reading, while 9 bq m-3 was the lowest reading detected in one area by one recording device in 2023. It is understood HMPS has been decanting prisoners whose cells registered a radon concentration of 154bq/m3. The BBC asked the prison service how much public funding had so far been spent on measures to reduce radon levels, but it declined to share this figure. Dr Maria Dugdale, chairman of the Radon Association, said: ""It's worrying that such high levels have been detected but not surprising given the area. ""What really matters with radon is not just the level you measure, but also the amount of time spent there. ""If somebody has spent significant amount of time in this sort of concentration that could be a problem with respect to health. ""Once high levels of radon have been identified in a workplace, further monitoring should be undertaken whilst remedial options are being considered and implemented."" She added: ""I think what's tricky is they have so many varying levels of radon it must be virtually impossible to figure out how much time people have spent in the different areas."" A former prisoner, who asked to remain anonymous, said he had received a letter detailing his estimated ""exposure level"", which was above the ""annual dose limit"" for the general public. ""It was there, putting everyone at risk, not just prisoners, staff as well. ""I just try not to think about it. I don't think it's anyone at the prison's fault. I think a lot of it came from above."" It is understood His Majestys Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) had previously closed or restricted access to certain areas of the prison affected by radon, while also using fans and ventilation. The installation of mechanical machines used to reduce radon levels has now been completed, it is understood. Meanwhile, monitoring is understood to be ongoing, while the MoJ continues to take steps to maintain prison capacity. Mark Day, deputy director of the Prison Reform Trust, said Dartmoor was an example of an ""old poorly located Victorian prison that should have been closed decades ago"". He said prison numbers were predicted to rise as high as 114,800 by March 2028: ""Decommissioning whole wings of the prison, while necessary given the dangerous levels of radon detected, will simply add to the crisis of capacity which the prison system is currently experiencing."" The FOI response from HMPPS and MoJ said: ""No prisoner or staff member has reported illness or adverse reaction to the radon exposure."" It said there were ""no safety implications to staff or prisoners who remain on site"". It added: ""For the last several years, we have been monitoring levels of radon in HMP Dartmoor and have already taken some steps to address initial results and protect prisoners and staff."" An HSE spokesperson said: We have written to His Majestys Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) informing them of legal requirements relating to radon exposures. The legal duty to keep prisoners and staff safe rests with HMPPS. However, our investigation is ongoing and we cannot comment further at this time. Towards the end of last year, a report from the Independent Monitoring Board said the Category C prison was overcrowded, understaffed, and under-resourced.

Staff at a Devon prison at the centre of an investigation into high levels of radioactive radon gas are concerned about their health, according to their union. Peak radon levels detected at HMP Dartmoor in 2020 and 2023 were 10 times the recommended workplace limit, according to the response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request submitted by the BBC. More than 400 prisoners have been moved from the Devon prison since December 2023. A Prison Service spokesperson said: ""Prisoners will be gradually returned to HMP Dartmoor following conversations with the Health and Safety Executive as we have ongoing mitigations in place to limit radon exposure.""

Prisoners released early to ease overcrowding,"A Scottish Prison Service spokesperson said: ""We have worked collaboratively with partners to prepare those approaching the end of their sentence for a supported early release. ""Governors have vetoed anyone they found posed an immediate risk to individuals or groups, with the help of intelligence from police and social work. ""The safety and wellbeing of people in our care, our staff, and the communities we support continues to be a key priority throughout, with information for victims and families available on our website."" Proposals for early prisoner release were announced in May following an ""unprecedented"" rise in the prison population. As of 12 June, there was 8,294 people behind bars. The Scottish government said the number of prisoners had increased by 400 since 18 March. In May, there was 8,365 prisoners in Scotland, the highest number since 2012. Scottish Prisons have a target operating capacity of 8,007. The plans were approved by Holyrood's Criminal Justice Committee on 12 June. While the cause of the increase in prisoners number is not yet known, Justice Secretary Angela Constance said there was a ""critical risk"" to the safe operation of the prison estate, with several prisons ""essentially full"". According to proposals, those serving a life sentence, those convicted of domestic abuse and those on the sex offenders register will not be eligible for early release, unless their conviction is spent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. Prisoner governors also have the power to prevent the release of any offender. The proposals also note that that a prisoner who is sentenced during the four-week release period could, in certain circumstances, be released the next day. Prisons On The Brink is available here on BBC iplayer. Lucy Adams investigates the impact of overcrowding, drugs and suicides on inmates and staff, and asks whether our crumbling prison estate can cope much longer. The release is to take place over four phases to provide certainty for those due to be released and to ensure reasonable planning can take place. These will take place weekly, beginning on Wednesday, and end on 18 July. The phased releases will also help to manage any potential impact on services, including victim support organisations. Victim Support Scotland expressed concerns over early prisoner release and warned it could create trauma, anxiety and ""essentially more victims"". The charity's chief executive Kate Wallace previously said: ""Victims are still feeling the impact of when prisoners released on an emergency basis during Covid, which resulted in numerous drug deaths and a 40% reoffending rate within the first six-months. Ms Wallace added the charity would work with the government to minimise the negative impact on victims and maximise the support available. Victims who are concerned about the impact this may have can contact them.

These will take place weekly, beginning on Wednesday, and end on 18 July. The phased releases will also help to manage any potential impact on services, including victim support organisations. Victim Support Scotland expressed concerns over early prisoner release and warned it could create trauma, anxiety and ""essentially more victims"". The charity's chief executive Kate Wallace previously said: ""Victims are still feeling the impact of when prisoners released on an emergency basis during Covid, which resulted in numerous drug deaths and a 40% reoffending rate within the first six-months. Ms Wallace added the charity would work with the government to minimise the negative impact on victims and maximise the support available. Victims who are concerned about the impact this may have can contact them. The first batch of prisoners to be released early from Scotland's jails are being freed, officials have said. Over the next four weeks between 500 and 550 inmates will leave custody to ease pressure on the country's overcrowded prisons. The move involves prisoners with 180 days or less to serve from a sentence of under four years. It will not apply to people convicted of sexual or domestic abuse offences. A Scottish Prison Service spokesperson said: ""We have worked collaboratively with partners to prepare those approaching the end of their sentence for a supported early release. ""Governors have vetoed anyone they found posed an immediate risk to individuals or groups, with the help of intelligence from police and social work. ""The safety and wellbeing of people in our care, our staff, and the communities we support continues to be a key priority throughout, with information for victims and families available on our website."" Proposals for early prisoner release were announced in May following an ""unprecedented"" rise in the prison population. As of 12 June, there was 8,294 people behind bars. The Scottish government said the number of prisoners had increased by 400 since 18 March. In May, there was 8,365 prisoners in Scotland, the highest number since 2012. Scottish Prisons have a target operating capacity of 8,007. The plans were approved by Holyrood's Criminal Justice Committee on 12 June. While the cause of the increase in prisoners number is not yet known, Justice Secretary Angela Constance said there was a ""critical risk"" to the safe operation of the prison estate, with several prisons ""essentially full"". According to proposals, those serving a life sentence, those convicted of domestic abuse and those on the sex offenders register will not be eligible for early release, unless their conviction is spent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974. Prisoner governors also have the power to prevent the release of any offender. The proposals also note that that a prisoner who is sentenced during the four-week release period could, in certain circumstances, be released the next day.

Prosecution rests in Menendez corruption trial,"Prosecutors have so far used expert testimony, emails and Mr Menendez's text messages to highlight what they claim is proof that the senator accepted lavish rewards from foreign governments. An FBI agent, for example, testified that Mr Menendez's internet search history showed that he repeatedly sought to determine the price of gold - including twice after a trip in which he and his wife Nadine had visited Egypt and Qatar. The agent testified that two of the gold bars, which were later recovered, were traced back to gold owned by Fred Daibes, a real-estate developer who is now on trial with Mr Menendez. An FBI search of Mr Menendez's home uncovered gold bars worth over $100,000 (£78,800), in addition to hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash. In opening statements, Mr Menendez's lawyer claimed that the gold had been passed down by Mrs Menendez's relatives in the Middle East. Jurors were also shown a text message exchange in which Mr Menendez asked a Qatari official for tickets for Mrs Menendez's son to attend the Formula One Grand Prix in Miami - which he eventually received. ""Thank you!! Mr Menendez wrote in response. ""He is thrilled and so is his mother."" At the time of the text message exchange, Mr Daibes was in talks to establish a business venture with a Qatari royal to whom Mr Menendez had introduced him. In his opening statement, Mr Menendez's lawyer Avi Weitzman sought to shift the blame on Mrs Menendez - who is facing her own, separate trial on bribery and corruption charges. She has pleaded not guilty. Mr Weitzman portrayed the Lebanese-born Mrs Menendez as a financially troubled individual who hopes to ""get cash and assets any way she could"" to resolve her money woes. ""Let me say this about Nadine: Nadine had financial concerns that she kept from Bob,"" Mr Weitzman said. Additionally Mr Weitzman said that the pair often led separate lives, with Mr Menendez more focused on his duties to his constituents. ""The government's allegations that the senator sold his office and his loyalty to his country are outrageously false,"" he said. ""Bob was doing his job, and he was doing it right."" Earlier this month, jurors heard from two FBI investigators who testified that they surveilled Mr Menendez and his wife as they dined with three Egyptian men, including a government official, at Morton's The Steakhouse, an upscale restaurant in Manhattan. The two-hour surveillance operation in May 2019 included FBI investigators posing as a well-dressed married couple seated near the Menendez table, as well as concealed cameras. One of the FBI agents, Terrie Williams-Thompson, testified that she overheard Mrs Menendez ask the group ""what else can the love of my life do you for?"", in a reference to the senator. Before the jury was seated, one of Mr Menendez's lawyers, Adam Fee, told the judge in the case that ""there is nothing unusual"" about having dinner ""with a diplomat or a friend"". Mr Menendez, he added, dines at Morton's approximately 250 nights of the year."
Protesters set fire to Kenya's parliament - but also saved two MPs,"Her colleague Mr Kosgei is from the ruling party that had backed the contentious legislation aimed at helping to eliminate the countrys national debt of nearly $80bn (£63bn). ""We were inside the chamber and all of a sudden our young men stormed in and everyone was looking for an escape route,"" Mr Kosgei told KTN TV. Those who had broken in began destroying furniture, part of the building was set on fire and a replica of the ceremonial mace, symbolising the authority of the legislature, was stolen. It usually decorates the reception of a new wing to the parliamentary complex. ""It was getting worse but my colleague Rose Museo and I made a choice to face the young men as we could not escape due to our disability,"" said Mr Kosgei, who became disabled after contracting polio as a child. The MP, who is also a bishop in an evangelical church, was uncertain of what would happen to him as he had voted in favour of the disputed bill. But the protesters did not hurt the legislators and instead they helped them to move to a safer area where they were later evacuated out of the building. ""They knew who I am and even knew how I had voted, said Mr Kosgei. But they told me that I was a good man and asked me to allow them to escort me out of the building because what would happen might not be good for me. The parliamentary invaders even offered to get him a taxi: ""They asked me whether I needed an Uber but I showed them where I wanted to stay as I knew that outside parliament was not safe. Ms Museo concurred, saying the altruistic attitude of the protesters came as a surprise. They addressed the two MPs, who by this stage were in the private members lounge, telling them that they meant no harm and were only agitating for what they believed was right. ""They were holding my hands, they told me: 'Our problem was the finance bill' - and not us,"" Ms Museo said. She admitted it was still a terrifying ordeal. ""But they were not harmful at all, they were very kind to me. They told me: 'You are our mother and we cannot hurt you.'"" Mr Kosgei thanked the protesters for ""saving my life and that of Ms Museo when everyone ran away"". ""Even in the moment of anger and stress, they still had humanity in them,"" he said. Millie Odhiambo, an MP known for not mincing her words, told a local newspaper she believed the protesters were just using the disabled MPs as human shields against a possible attack by police officers. But Ms Museo said there was no police presence at the time the protesters were helping her. She added that she did not blame her colleagues for fleeing as everyone had been justifiably frightened by the invasion. The lawmakers led by Speaker Moses Wetang'ula were whisked away through the tunnel which connects the debating chambers for the senate and national assembly to a new wing where MPs officers are located. The office section of the building is known as the Bunge Towers and was opened in April. Police eventually managed to drive the protesters from the building amid clouds of tear gas and the sound of gunfire. The MPs were hiding in basement bunkers under Bunge Towers until an evacuation was organised. To exit the complex some legislators, including Senate Speaker Amason Kingi, were put in ambulances as protesters were hurling stones at MPs' vehicles, local media reported. Later that evening, President William Ruto termed the invasion of parliament a ""treasonous"" act and an ""existential threat"". But given the scale of the protests  medics say at least 23 people died on Tuesday - Mr Ruto bowed to pressure and said the legislation would be withdrawn. He said he would start a dialogue with Kenyan youth and work on austerity measures, beginning with cuts to the budget of the presidency. For Ms Museo the traumatic events have been a learning curve for politicians and show the power of the people. She urged the parliamentary authorities to put in place a proper evacuation system for MPs with disabilities. She also urged the presidents call for dialogue to be taken seriously. ""The protesters are agitated, and rightfully so, but their voices were heard and they should now give dialogue a chance,"" Ms Museo said. ""They can go back to the streets if they will not be satisfied after the dialogue.""

""I was very scared and I prayed to God as about 22 young protesters surrounded me,"" MP Rose Museo, who uses crutches, told the BBC. She and her colleague Jackson Kosgei, who uses a wheelchair, were left stranded during the two-hour assault from which their colleagues escaped by scampering for safety through an underground tunnel. The youthful protesters smashed windows and eventually made their way into the chambers in unprecedented scenes that left parts of parliament badly damaged. Some even set part of the building on fire. As an opposition MP, Ms Museo had just voted against the bill they were angry about. When the protests began last week they were largely peaceful, with thousands of mainly young demonstrators marching in the capital, Nairobi, and across the country against a controversial finance bill that would have hiked taxes and introduced a slew of other levies. But tensions flared on Tuesday afternoon when the bill was passed by parliament - despite the demonstrations that had attracted much bigger numbers that day. Police officers opened fire on the crowds who had massed around parliament - and minutes after the MPs had voted, furious protesters broke into the assembly's compound. ""Everybody was gone and I couldn't use the lifts because the power was cut off,"" said Ms Museo, who was injured in a road accident in 2017. Her colleague Mr Kosgei is from the ruling party that had backed the contentious legislation aimed at helping to eliminate the countrys national debt of nearly $80bn (£63bn).

He said: ""When we ask businesses to close down for a day over and above those already allocated as bank holidays, with virtually no ability to plan, we immediately place a significant, additional, unbudgeted cost burden on our local businesses. ""I've been approached by many local businesses, who feel that this Assembly is simply not listening to them.""

""Some of the recipes include things like green peas but it's really easy to swap out for any vegetable or anything you have laying about."" The group of eight pupils formed last September and decided to create a product tackling food waste due to the environmental and financial impact for their UK Young Enterprise Business entry.

You are not the only one, as the average person wastes 100kg (220lbs) of food a year, according to Wrap Cymru, a climate action group. A recipe book detailing how to use left-overs has won students at Ysgol Gyfun Penweddig, Aberystwyth, first prize at a UK youth enterprise competition. Their bilingual book, Sbarion - Datrysiad i Wastraff [Leftovers - A Solution to Waste] has also earned the team of Year 10 and 12 pupils a place at a European final in Sicily next week.

Putin warns South Korea against arming Ukraine,"While South Korea has given humanitarian aid and military equipment to Ukraine, it has so far refused to provide lethal weapons as it has an official policy not to arm countries at war. Some in Ukraine have been hoping that the deepening military collaboration between Moscow and Pyongyang would cause Seoul to rethink its approach. Analysts had earlier said that Kyiv would use Mr Putin's visit to Pyongyang to up the pressure. During the visit, Mr Kim had also pledged ""full support"" for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. There is growing evidence that Russia has already been deploying North Korean missiles in Ukraine. Early on Friday the US national security council's spokesman John Kirby weighed in on the Russian-North Korean agreement, saying it should ""be of concern to any country that cares about maintaining peace and stability"" in the region. He added that the agreement was ""no surprise"", saying that the US had been warning about the two countries' ""burgeoning defence relationship"" for many months. Tokyo said it was seriously concerned that President Putin did not rule out military technology co-operation with North Korea, Japan's government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi said, adding that the agreement was ""unacceptable"". Analysts have said that the treaty could have significant implications for the world as well as the region. Besides the possibility of North Korean openly arming Russia, it could also potentially see Russia intervening in any fresh conflict on the Korean peninsula. The two Koreas are still technically at war and maintain a heavily guarded border, where tensions have worsened in recent weeks. In a separate incident on Thursday, North Korean troops ""briefly crossed"" the border  and retreated after the South fired warning shots, Seoul authorities said on Friday. This marks the third such incident in less than three weeks. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff had said the two earlier cases - on 9 June and 18 June - appeared to be unintentional.

Additional reporting by Jean Mackenzie. Vladimir Putin has warned South Korea it would be making ""a big mistake"" if it arms Ukraine in the war against Russia. His comments come after Seoul said it was considering such a possibility, in response to Russia and North Korea's new pact to help each other in the event of ""aggression"" against either country. Moscow ""will... [make] decisions which are unlikely to please the current leadership of South Korea"" if Seoul decides to supply arms to Kyiv, Mr Putin told reporters on Thursday. The Russian leader was speaking in Vietnam, shortly after a lavish visit to Pyongyang where he signed a mutual defence agreement with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Mr Putin also warned that Moscow is willing to arm Pyongyang if the US and its allies continue supplying Ukraine with weapons. ""Those who supply these weapons believe that they are not at war with us. I said, including in Pyongyang, that we then reserve the right to supply weapons to other regions of the world,"" Mr Putin said. Seoul had earlier condemned the Russian-North Korean agreement as a threat to its national security, and national security adviser Chang Ho-jin had said his country planned to ""reconsider the issue of arms support to Ukraine"". Following Mr Putin's remarks, South Korea's presidential office said on Friday it would consider ""various options"" in supplying arms to Ukraine and its stance will ""depend on how Russia approaches this issue"". It also summoned the Russian ambassador Georgy Zinoviev to protest the pact, demanding that Moscow ""immediately ceases"" military cooperation with Pyongyang.

Questions raised over rising council sick days,"The figures were discussed at the councils resources and fire and rescue overview and scrutiny committee meeting this week. Overall, they showed absence rates were creeping up, with the average number of sick days for a full-time equivalent council employee at 9.86 per year. The authority's target for sick days per staff member is eight, with a tolerance of one either way. The figure was 9.16 in September 2023 and 8.99 a year ago, councillors heard. The council describes itself as a large employer with over 5,000 employees. Councillor Tim Sinclair said he wanted to know if pressures were increasing in certain departments and ""what the story is there"". Bal Jacob, the councils director of workforce and local services, said they recognised sickness had increased but understood where the challenges were and where improvements and more support were needed, which was ""in place"". We are doing a lot more awareness sessions particularly around mental health and wellbeing,"" she added. Our trend isnt different to any national trends at the moment, we are not an outlier in that sense but we are doing whatever we can to try to reduce our levels. Mr Sinclair said he could see ""there is a lot of work going into helping people"". ""There may be value in this committee having a deeper understanding of what is being done so we look after them,"" he added.

Railway locomotive celebrates 30 years of service,"Mr Antoli? added that volunteers, led by chief engineer Tim Leverton, had spent ""many hours of their lives ensuring this loco is the pride of the fleet"". The locomotive, also known as a British Rail (BR) Blue ""47"", has worked longer in preservation than it did during its career with BR. ""The Brush Type 4 was popular with train crews the length and breadth of Britain, with the locos well up to the tasks that were put their way.

The locomotive is owned by The Brush Type 4 Fund and was built by Brush Electrical Machines Ltd at its Falcon Works in Loughborough in 1963. The locomotive first came out for British Rail in December 1963 and was withdrawn from service in December 1993. It had served all over, including in the Bristol area and in Birmingham.

Rapist who faked victim WhatsApp messages jailed,"Prosecutor Paul Cleasby said McDougal invited the woman to his home to smoke cannabis in a safe place where she would not be ""preyed upon by creepy men"". He then raped her despite her repeated protestations for him to stop, Mr Cleasby said. McDougal had denied rape but jurors unanimously found him guilty after a five-day trial in August 2023. In November last year, while awaiting sentencing, he called 999 to say three masked men had burst into his home and demanded he hand over an envelope containing printed out WhatsApp messages. McDougal told police the envelope had been pushed through his door and contained messages between his victim and another person in which she admitted lying about the rape. Mr Cleasby said ""no supporting evidence of any robbery was found"" and the detective who had investigated the rape recognised McDougal's style of writing in the alleged posts. McDougal admitted creating the messages himself on his mother's laptop and told police he had been ""hearing voices in his head which had taken control of him"". In a statement, the woman said she had been ""scarred for life"" by the rape and McDougal's ""selfish"" attempt to ""turn the tables"" had re-victimised her. She said he was a ""dangerous and manipulative man"" and she hoped he would now have the ""decency"" to leave her alone. Representing himself on the rape charge, McDougal, of Newton Walk, said the ""spur of the moment"" sex had been consensual and he disputed the woman's claims about the impact it had had on her. Judge Stephen Earl warned McDougal, who was appearing via video link from prison, that ""victim blaming"" was ""probably not [the] best line"" of mitigation, prompting the rapist to apologise. Mitigating for him on the perverting justice charge, Sarah Lish said McDougal had been on morphine at the time after being seriously injured in an accident, with the drug blamed for his ""psychosis"". Judge Earl said McDougal's offending was of a ""very predatory nature"" and he was ""incapable of any form of empathy"" towards the woman. The judge said the rape was of ""such an horrendous nature against someone so young and vulnerable"" and McDougal was the ""very sort"" of ""creepy"" man he had claimed to be protecting the woman from. The judge said McDougal's ""bizarre"" attempt to conjure up evidence to discredit the woman was ""awful"". An indefinite restraining order banning McDougal from contacting the woman or referring to her on social media was also handed down. Follow BBC Tees on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

Recycling firm fined over wood dust dangers,"A recycling company that put its employees in danger through exposure to wood dust has been fined £160,000. Esken Renewables Limited, in Middlesbrough, failed to design processes to minimise the spread of wood dust, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) found. The HSE said the dust could cause asthma and nasal cancer if inhaled. At Teesside Magistrates' Court, the company admitted breaching a regulation involving the control of hazardous substances. An HSE inspector visited the site in Port Clarence Road in April 2022 after concerns were raised about wood dust spreading to the surrounding area. Esken Renewables said the exposures were due to four storms, which the HSE accepted. However, an investigation found the ""control of wood dust to protect employees working on and around the site was not adequate and fell short of the expected benchmark"". ""The company failed to design and operate processes and activities to minimise emission, release and spread of wood dust,"" the HSE said. Esken Renewables Limited pleaded guilty to breaching a control of substances hazardous to health regulation. It was fined £160,000 and ordered to pay £5,310.35 in costs, along with a £190 victim surcharge. Esken Renewables said the wellbeing of its employees was a ""top priority"". A spokesperson for the firm said: ""We were very disappointed to learn that on this occasion we didnt meet the regulatory requirements and our own high standards of care and protection that we aim to provide for our employees. ""Were constantly revising our policies and procedures to ensure that we comply with all regulations and that we provide the highest standards of protection for everyone who works for us."" Esken Renewables was acquired by Pioneer Balmoral UK in December 2023. The spokesperson said health and safety one of Pioneer Balmoral's ""core principles"".

"Reform UK activist's racial slur hurts, says Sunak","Conservative leader Rishi Sunak said he was ""hurt"" and ""angry"" after a Reform UK canvasser used a racist term to describe him. Secret recordings published by Channel 4 show a canvasser working to get Reform UK leader Nigel Farage elected as MP for Clacton using a racial slur to refer to the prime minister - who is of Indian origin. Reform UK said those making ""unacceptable comments"" will no longer be part of Mr Farage's campaign. Speaking to reporters, Mr Sunak said ""my two daughters have to see and hear Reform people who campaigned for Nigel Farage"" using racist language against him. ""It hurts. And it makes me angry,"" he said. Mr Farage ""has some questions to answer,"" he added. ""When you see Reform candidates and campaigners, seemingly using racist and misogynistic language and opinions seemingly without challenge, I think it tells you something about the culture within the Reform Party."" In responding to the comments, Mr Sunak chose to repeat the racist term, saying: I do it deliberately and I hate having to do it. ""I chose my words deliberately and I hate having to repeat them, absolutely hate it but I also think its important to call this out for what it is and be clear about what it is."" Essex Police have confirmed they are ""urgently assessing"" comments made by Reform campaigners in Channel 4's footage ""to establish if there are any criminal offences"". Footage broadcast by Channel 4 shows racist and Islamophobic slurs apparently being made by Andrew Parker, identified as a canvasser for Mr Farage. Mr Parker tells an undercover reporter he has ""always been a Tory voter"" but he is ""annoyed"" by Mr Sunak, who he referred to using a racial slur. Mr Parker is also heard describing Islam as ""the most disgusting cult out"" and suggesting army recruits should carry out target practice by shooting at small boats bringing illegal migrants to the UK. At one point Mr Parker tells voters Reform would be ""kicking all the Muslims out of the mosques and turning them into Wetherspoons"". During campaigning, he advises the undercover reporter to use the term ""illegal"" when discussing immigration, especially when addressing non-white households. Ahead of the publication of the footage, Mr Parker made a statement to Channel 4 claiming ""neither Nigel Farage personally or the Reform Party are aware of my personal views on immigration"". Mr Parker said: I have never discussed immigration with either Nigel Farage or the Reform Party and that any comments made by me during those recordings are my own personal views on any subject I commented on. I would therefore like to apologise profusely to Nigel Farage and the Reform Party if my personal views have reflected badly on them and brought them into disrepute as this was not my intention."" Mr Farage has claimed Channel 4's undercover filming was a ""total set up"", with Mr Parker a hired actor.

Reform candidate defects to Tories over racism row,"A Reform UK election candidate has disowned the party and is instead backing the local Conservative candidate. Liam Booth-Isherwood, who is standing in Erewash, said there was a significant moral issue in parts of the party following what he called reports of widespread racism and sexism. He added that the failure of the partys leadership to address the issue means he no longer wants to be associated with it. Reform UK have been approached for comment. Earlier this week the party distanced itself from two activists filmed by Channel 4 apparently making racist and offensive comments. And over the weekend it said it had disowned itself from three candidates over other offensive remarks. Earlier in the day, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage addressed a rally in Birmingham where he said his party would become the ""voice of the opposition"". He labelled the prime minister ""slippery Sunak"" and said Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer had the ""charisma of damp rag"". Mr Farage admitted his party ""had a few bad apples but insisted: The bad apples are gone. However, he also attacked Channel 4 and the production company it used to produce the report on Reform, which included footage of one of its canvassers, Andrew Parker, using a racial slur about the prime minister. Another activist, George Jones, was also filmed making offensive comments. Reform has said Mr Jones is  ""no longer involved"" in the party's campaign. While addressing supporters, Mr Farage reiterated his claim that Mr Parker was an actor and that the Channel 4 programme was part of the ""biggest put-up job and smear campaign in my entire life"". Responding to a similar attack from Mr Farage on Friday, Channel 4 said it stood by its ""rigorous and duly impartial journalism"", adding that it met Mr Parker for the first time at Reform UK party headquarters and had not paid him any money. In a statement, Mr Parker said he wanted to ""apologise profusely to Nigel Farage and the Reform Party if my personal views have reflected badly on them and brought them into disrepute as this was not my intention"". The BBC has contacted Mr Jones for a comment. In a statement released on Sunday, Mr Booth-Isherwood said he was leaving Reform and suspending his campaign ""with immediate effect"". Whilst I have campaigned alongside many decent, honest and hardworking people during the course of the general election campaign in Erewash, the reports of widespread racism and sexism in Reform have made clear that there is a significant moral issue within certain elements of the party. ""The failure of the partys leadership to not only take this matter seriously, but also to fundamentally address it, has made clear to me that this is no longer a party I want to be associated with."" He said he was backing the Conservative Party candidate, Maggie Throup, saying: ""Only she can stop Labour. Although Mr Booth-Isherwood is suspending his campaign it is too late to change the ballot papers and he will still appear as Reform's candidate. Following the Channel 4 report, Mr Farage appeared on the BBC's Question Time Leader's Special, where he faced several hostile questions about racism in his party. Mr Farage later claimed the BBC had ""rigged"" the programme with ""hand-picked"" audience members. A BBC spokesperson said: ""We refute these claims"", adding that the audience was ""made up of broadly similar levels of representation from Reform UK and the Green Party, with the other parties represented too"". ""There were also a number of people, with a range of political views, who were still making up their mind. On Sunday, Mr Farage intensified his criticism of the BBC saying it had  ""abused its position of power"" and was becoming a ""political actor"" in the election. He received loud cheers from his supporters when he said his party would campaign to abolish the licence fee. When Mr Sunak called the election on 22 May, Mr Farage initially said he would not stand as an MP. However, he later changed his mind and said he would not only be running as a candidate but was taking over as leader of Reform. Addressing enthusiastic supporters in Birmingham, he said he ""couldn't bear to stand aside"" while the election campaign took place. He said he didn't think his party would get many seats on Thursday, but said the election was the ""first major step"" on the way to creating a ""mass movement"". Earlier in the day, Mr Farage dismissed as ""cobblers"" allegations there could be Russian interference in the election. The Australian Broadcasting Company (ABC) has said it identified five Facebook pages with a combined 190,000 followers promoting a Kremlin perspective and sometimes posting support for Mr Farages Reform UK party. Conservative Party chair Richard Holden has written to the UK's top civil servant and National Security Adviser asking for an investigation into claims that Russian actors are interfering in the general election. Deputy prime minister Oliver Dowden said the report was ""gravely concerning"". In response, Mr Farage said: ""How dare he - when their party has taken millions of pounds of Russian money over the last few years.""

Replica of Spanish galleon moors at city's quay,"""Sailors could have no food or water, theyd have to drink vinegar. Thankfully its much better for us nowadays,"" he said. The galleon was developed by the Spanish Nao Victoria Foundation and the ship tours the world with a crew of between 15 and 35 people at any one time. Mr Perezherce, said he had loved working as part of the crew for the last three months. He added it was great to share Spains ""past culture"" with the world. The Andalucia weighs more than 500 tonnes, which is more than 50 double-decker buses and is the length of a football pitch. Ben Whitfield, from Newcastles NE1, which helped bring the ship to the region along with Newcastle City Council and The Port of Tyne, said they expected the exhibit to ""attract big crowds over the summer"". The ship had previously been stationed in Blyth and it will remain in Newcastle until  7 July. Follow BBC Newcastle on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

Residents unhappy over new tennis court fees,"The council said renovation funds had come from the government and the LTA Tennis Foundation. Work at Allen Park and Southfields has been completed, but is continuing at the other three parks. The National Tennis Association (NTA) has been appointed to manage the courts, which will have to be booked once the booking system is operating. Until then, the courts remain free to use. ""The introduction of these fees will contribute to a dedicated fund aimed at financing future repairs and maintenance of the courts,"" the council said. It added it would participate in an LTA initiative to see ""two hours of free informal tennis play each week"". Mrs Cowin has sons aged 10, 13 and 15, and said: ""It really saddens me that my boys no longer have free access to the courts. ""Over the years we've often gone for spontaneous play. It feels like a really poorly thought out decision, and means many people will just not be able to afford to play sport that can be so good for mental health."" A mother, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ""I think these restrictions will reduce the numbers of people playing from about 100 a week to about 10 to 20. ""No-one pays for basketball, football, Parkrun, so why tennis? ""It's supposed to be making people healthier, not putting in barriers.""

But with sightings of Dr Ruja still coming in, can it be true? A reward for information leading to the arrest of Ruja Ignatova, known as the Missing Cryptoqueen, has been increased by US authorities to $5m (£4m). The Bulgarian-born German woman, 44, is wanted by the FBI for orchestrating a $4.5bn cryptocurrency scam called OneCoin. She has been missing since 2017 when US officials signed an arrest warrant and investigators began closing in on her. Three weeks ago, a BBC podcast and documentary revealed her links to the Bulgarian underworld and the suspected mafia boss involved in her disappearance and, allegedly, her possible murder. However authorities continue to pursue Ms Ignatova. In 2022, the FBI added her to its top 10 most wanted list, offering a $100,000 reward, later upped to $250,000. On Wednesday, that amount increased again twenty-fold, under the US State Departments Transnational Organised Crime Reward Program. ""We are offering  a reward up to $5 million for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of German national Ruja Ignatova, known as 'Cryptoqueen,' for her role in one of the largest global fraud schemes in history,"" said US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller. She is currently the only woman targeted under the US programme. An equivalent $5m reward is on offer for information about Daniel Kinahan, named as the head of one of Europes biggest drug cartels. The same amount is on offer for information about Semion Mogilevich, alleged to be a Russia-based crime boss, and Yulan Adonay Archaga Carías, known as Porky, the highest-ranking member of the MS-13 criminal gang in Honduras.

Rishi Sunak meets veterans to mark Armed Forces Day,"The seaside event also included live music from The Yorkshire Volunteers Band, an acrobatic display and a parade. Visitors were treated to displays by the RAF Eurofighter Typhoon FGR4 and the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Spitfire and Hurricane, from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire. World War Two veteran Ray Whitwell, 105, was the guest of honour. In Harrogate, a service took place at Stonefall Cemetery to mark members of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force - the volunteer arm of the RAF - who lost their lives in service. Details of the lives of some of those volunteers who are buried at the cemetery have been released by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission as part of a project to celebrate the RAAF. Speaking after the event, Wing Cdr Howard Leader said: ""Today is an important commemorative event as part of our 100th anniversary year. This year we are marking 100 years of volunteer reserve service. ""Over that 100 years a lot of reservists have served all around the world in support of RAF operations."" He added: ""Of course in the nature of the work that they do, a number of those people have lost their lives in active service. ""Todays commemorative service is about remembering all of those fallen forebears of ours and remembering also, that wherever the RAF deploys today the RAAF goes with them, and occasionally still there are sadly casualties, and we will be thinking of those people too.""

Rival candidates debate impact of Reform UK,"Liberal Democrat candidate in Stratford-on-Avon, Manuela Perteghella, told the programme her party shared ""no values"" with Reform UK, while Birmingham Ladywood Labour candidate Shabana Mahmood said all political parties should be ""united"" on calling out the ""vile"" and ""hideous"" remarks.

But she said voters should not believe Labour would tackle immigration, which she claimed would not be high on the party's agenda. Peter Durnell, regional manager for West Midlands Reform UK, told the programme the party expected 5,000 people at the event, paying £5 for entry. He told the BBC: ""Birmingham is really on the map and is buzzing for Reform UK."" Mr Durnell predicted the party would get two or three seats, but hoped for ""several more."" Dame Harriett told the programme that a vote for Reform could mean giving Labour a ""super-majority"" in the new House of Commons. ""There is no question that a vote for Reform means more Labour MPs and exactly the opposite on what a lot of Reform voters want. ""Voting for Reform could make sure that Keir Starmer has 100 additional MPs and a super-majority which would effectively be a blank cheque to Labour who have not spelt out what they're planning to do in their manifesto"", she said. Ms Mahmood called the comment ""insecure"" and said voters wanted a change from a Tory government. She said: ""All political parties can be united on this - there should be no place in our country and politics for racism and we should all take a strong position in calling that out.

Rohingya: Gang violence stalks world's largest refugee camp,"She fears that spiralling gang violence there will make a widow of another Rohingya woman like herself, with young children to feed. Ms Khatun's husband, Bashir Ullah, became a grim statistic last June when he was shot dead after getting caught in the crossfire of two gangs at Cox's Bazar in south-east Bangladesh. That night, he volunteered to patrol the sprawling camp that the Rohingyas have called home for six years now. Drug smuggling and human trafficking gangs have turned life at Cox's Bazar into a nightmare for the close to one million ethnic minority Rohingyas, many of whom crossed into Bangladesh from Myanmar in 2017 to escape a military crackdown. Forty-eight people have died in gang violence as of mid-July, exceeding the 40 fatalities for all of 2022. The violence complicates the plight of the Rohingyas. Their return to Myanmar is uncertain while their host, Bangladesh considers them a burden. Squalid conditions in Cox's Bazar have also made them vulnerable to disasters, like massive fires and typhoons. Those feelings of frustration and helplessness are being exploited by various armed groups such as the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), the Rohingya Solidarity Organisation (RSO) and the Munna Gang. ""We fled from the Myanmar military to save our lives. I hardly imagined that my husband would be killed in our camp by another Rohingya,"" Ms Khatun, 31, told the BBC. ""I cannot sleep at night. We want to leave the camp. I don't know what the future holds for me and my sons,"" she added. Mohammed Mizanur Rahman, a senior official in charge of Bangladesh's Refugee Relief and Repatriation commission said drug peddlers were using Rohingya as carriers to smuggle drugs from Myanmar into Bangladesh. ""There are a million people without any opportunities. That creates space for criminals. They are violent and need to be held to account,"" Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia Director at Human Rights Watch told the BBC. Mohib Ullah, a prominent Rohingya rights leader is among the victims of the spiralling violence. He was shot dead while speaking to a refugee gathering in September 2021. The groups are also accused of abducting people for ransom, as well as forced marriage and child recruitment. One of their former captives, who asked to be identified only as Nur, told the BBC that he had been tortured while being held in a forest area near the border town of Teknaf for four days. ""I was made to stand in a stream day and night and was constantly beaten with wires and sticks. I thought I won't make it,"" said the 21-year-old who now lives in a south-east Asian capital. Nur said the ARSA militants demanded a ransom of $18,000 (£14,126) for his release, but his parents raised only about $2300. He managed to escape after the group asked for the remainder of the ransom. A spokesman for ARSA did not respond to a request for comment. Bangladeshi authorities say their worries of deteriorating security in the Rohingya areas are becoming a reality. The UN and aid agencies find themselves stretched for resources to provide for the Rohingyas as international attention shifts to the war in Ukraine. Monthly food vouchers have been cut to $8 from $12 per person. Bangladesh says it has deployed more than 2,000 personnel from the Armed Police Battalion to secure refugee camps. But the only solution to stop the violence, authorities say, is to repatriate the Rohingyas back to Myanmar. Myanmar and Bangladesh agreed on a possible repatriation of refugees in 2017 but there has been little progress. In recent months, Myanmar has shown some interest in taking back some refugees, if not all, following a China-backed initiative. More than 1,000 Rohingya have been shortlisted to be sent back in a pilot project. But the Rohingyas are not happy with this. ""Unless our safety and security are guaranteed, unless we are allowed to go back to our villages, we are not keen on repatriation,"" says a Rohingya activist who did not want to be identified. With their fate uncertain, dozens of Rohingya are taking perilous high seas journeys via seas aboard rickety boats to escape to Indonesia and Malaysia, often paying huge sum to human traffickers. Dozens drown every year attempting the sea crossing. Six years after reaping worldwide praise for accepting Rohingya refugees, Bangladesh now faces a huge dilemma. With foreign aid dwindling, Dhaka says it's spending more of its own resources to manage the camps. At the same time, the worsening security situation is triggering alarm. And widows of the violence, like Ms Khatun, continue to live a nightmare. Sounds of gunfire keep Modina Khatun awake every night in Cox's Bazaar Bangladesh - the world's largest refugee camp. She fears that spiralling gang violence there will make a widow of another Rohingya woman like herself, with young children to feed.

Rolex 'eaten by cow' reappears after 50 years,"A farmer who believed his prized Rolex watch was eaten by a cow has been reunited with the timepiece half a century later. James Steele, 95, said he lost the watch in the early 1970s when he ""suddenly realised"" its bracelet had broken. Mr Steele, of Shropshire, said: ""The cow could have eaten it with a mouthful of grass, the vet said."" Now, a metal detectorist has given back the watch to the owner of Treflach Hall in Morda, Oswestry, after finding it on his land. Mr Steele described the discovery as a ""stroke of luck"" and said it was ""amazing""  after all this time. ""I was quite pleased because I never thought I would see the watch again,"" he said. ""But I have got it now. I only have half the bracelet - the other half must have disintegrated. ""I have the watch but it is not going. The face has gone greenish but it has not rusted up."" Mr Steele praised the metal detectorist who found the watch, saying he could have quite easily not owned up to his discovery. More valuables could still be found, the farmer said, encouraging the metal detectorist to keep working his land. As for the watch, Mr Steele said it will now just be a keepsake as it would ""cost a bomb"" to do anything with. Follow BBC Shropshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

The Wisbech Rose Fair, in Cambridgeshire, stopped running because of the Covid-19 pandemic, a lack of volunteers and running costs. However, Wisbech Town Council has promised to ""safeguard"" its future. The event, on Saturday, 29 June, will also feature the daring gardening skills of the Blue Barrow display team, made up of local Royal Air Force cadets. ""Covid first ended it, but after that volunteers were getting older and losing energy,"" said Rose Fair committee member Alan Wheeldon. ""But now we have enrolled over 20 people from all different walks of life. ""I think it is fantastic to have the fair back. ""It really brings the whole community together."" The festival sees lorry floats take part in a parade through the market town and floral displays in St Peter & St Paul's Parish Church.

Row over Lakes housing and transport scheme,"The Gateway scheme would create 150 homes at a site at Orrest Head Farm on the outskirts of the town.

Runner clawed by swooping buzzard in Mourne Mountains,"The buzzard is a protected species and is the most widespread UK bird of prey. Their wingspan can vary from 48in (122cm) up to 60in (152cm). The buzzard is sometimes known as the ""tourist eagle"" because people commonly mistake it for its larger fellow raptor. Mr Morgan runs for Barf, the Belfast Association of Rock-climbers and Fell Runners. ""I wanted to do a nine-mile run and I know there was an eight mile loop around near Donard Forest, so I decided to do that because it's a bit more sheltered when the weather isn't great,"" he said. ""About six miles into my run, just after I took a phone call, I got the first swoop and I could really feel the claws on my head. ""You really do hear it when they swoop and one of them hit me three times, I ended up looking up and shouting 'Enough!'. After I could feel the blood dripping down and around my eyes."" Mr Morgan said despite being not seriously injured in the incident, he was left quite shaken and took a different route back to avoid encountering the birds again. Mr Morgan said it is important that walkers, runners and hikers in the area are aware that these birds are there and may feel threatened by their presence. Buzzards have been a bit of a success story on the island of Ireland. They were extinct by the start of the 20th century mostly due to human persecution, but spread in from Scotland via County Antrim all over the island. Like most birds during nesting season, their priority will be to protect their young.

A man has urged people to be vigilant after he was injured by swooping buzzards while running near the Mourne Mountains. Steven Morgan said he has experienced two separate incidents involving birds swooping down on him near Fofanny Dam Reservoir and in Donard Forest over the past number of weeks. A Royal Society for the Protection of Birds spokesperson told BBC News NI that one possible reason for a buzzard or buzzards to act in this way is that they they are ""defending its nest or young"". The RSPB said it would be rare that buzzards come into physical contact with people. The spokesperson advised that as this is still the bird's nesting season, people should give areas where they are known to be located ""a wide berth until the birds have left the nest"". One incident earlier this month left Mr Morgan bleeding, with several cuts to his head. Another incident involving a swooping bird happened while he was out on a run in woods on Thursday. Mr Morgan told BBC News NI that he believes a number of buzzards are nesting in the area and may have mistaken him as a threat to their chicks.

SNP would work with Labour to boost migration to Scotland,"SNP leader John Swinney has said he would work with an incoming Labour government at Westminster to boost immigration to Scotland. He told the BBC's The Sunday Show he would welcome and engage positively with any plan to use immigration to address skills and workforce shortages. Scottish Labour's deputy leader Jackie Baillie has told the Herald on Sunday her party would look at ways to ""incentivise"" migrants to the UK settling in Scotland. But Mr Swinney cautioned that Labour had taken a ""very hostile"" attitude to immigration south of the border. ""Keir Starmer and Yvette Cooper are on every UK television channel saying they are going to shut the door on immigration,"" he said. Migration has been a major issue of the election campaign with both the Conservatives and Reform UK saying numbers coming into the UK are too high. Labour has promised to reduce net migration, clamp down on illegal trafficking and reform the points-based system for visas. Research suggests it is less of an issue for Scottish voters where the proportion of working age adults is shrinking and sectors like agriculture, the care sector and hospitality have voiced concern about recruiting staff. Four years ago the Scottish government proposed a pilot scheme for a ""Scottish visa"" which would exempt certain businesses from UK rules on hiring overseas workers, but it was blocked by the Home Office. Mr Swinney said he welcomed reports that Labour, if elected, might work with the Scottish government to ensure UK policy recognised Scotland's particular needs. ""If it's an indication of some of the practical steps that might come from inter-governmental relations with an incoming Labour government, then nobody will engage in that more strongly than me,"" he said. He added that prior to the SNP coming to power in 2007, his party supported the ""fresh talent"" initiative developed by the Labour/Lib Dem coalition at Holyrood. In wide-ranging interview, Mr Swinney  attacked both the Conservatives and Labour for a ""conspiracy of silence"" over the crisis in public finances. He repeated his claim - denied by Labour - that it would introduce £18bn of cuts by signing up to the same fiscal rules as the Tories. Mr Swinney has called for Scotland's higher taxation rates for higher earners to be emulated across the UK to finance more public spending. Currently people in Scotland earning below £28,850 pay slightly less tax than the rest of the UK but above that figure they pay increasingly more. The SNP leader said more tax powers should be devolved to Holyrood, including the ability to set the VAT rate, currently at 20%, but he declined to be ""boxed in"" by saying how his government might use that power. He said he took responsibility for services like the NHS and education which are devolved to the Scottish Parliament, but he said it was also his duty to explain the financial constraints his government was operating under. He said: ""I don't have 100% control over the money that's raised in Scotland. ""I've got control over part of it - I take responsibility for that and I explain what we do with that. That's why we've increased the tax on higher earners. ""But there's a huge wad of the resources that come to us through the block grant that I do not control and I think it's only fair that I give the public an explanation that the UK political parties have signed up to an approach that will cut our public spending."" On Scottish independence, he was asked if a victory in Scotland for Labour - which opposes another referendum -  would be a signal that the matter should not be pursued for the next five years. Mr Swinney said it was a ""complex question"" because he believes the result of the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, which returned a majority of pro-independence MSPs, provided a mandate that ""should be honoured"". Mr Swinney also denied that the launch of the SNP campaign bus in just the final week of the campaign was a sign of the party's declining fortunes. He said he had taken a decision to deliver a final push for votes and it would have been a ""waste of money"" to have a campaign bus for the whole six weeks. He acknowledged that the SNP had been through a ""tough time"" recently but said he had succeeded in bringing the party back together since he took over from Humza Yousaf shortly before the general election was called. ""In that time I've united the Scottish National Party, I've got the party focused outwards on a positive election campaign about providing hope and an alternative to the straitjacket of Westminster control in Scotland,"" he said. The Scottish Conservatives said the election was a chance for voters to end the SNP's ongoing pursuit of Scottish independence. Deputy leader Meghan Gallacher said: John Swinney can try to dupe voters all he wants, but independence is page one, line one one of the SNP manifesto for a reason. He will use every SNP MP elected on Thursday to try to split up the UK."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Alex Cole-Hamilton said the SNP had failed to take responsibility for the state of public services after 17 years in power. This interview showed the SNP have been in power for too long and have nothing to say for those waiting for a GP or a dentist,"" he said. ""They have nothing to say for those concerned about schools slipping down the rankings, and nothing to say about the Scottish government-owned water company dumping sewage in our rivers.""

Sabrina the Teenage Witch star Martin Mull dies at 80,"American actor and comedian Martin Mull, known for his work on the TV sitcoms Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Roseanne, has died at age 80. Mull, who also starred in the 1985 comedy film Clue, died on Thursday at his home after a valiant fight against a long illness, his daughter, Maggie Mull, said on social media. In a tribute on Instagram, Ms Mull wrote that her father was known for excelling at every creative discipline imaginable and for doing Red Roof Inn commercials"". He would find that joke funny, she added. He was never not funny. Mulls first notable role was in 1976, playing Garth Gimble on the soap opera spoof Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman, which led to two additional spin-off roles, including in the series Fernwood 2 Night. He then landed the role of army officer Colonel Mustard in the black-comedy film Clue, inspired by the board game of the same name. Around that time, he also began voicing the Red Roof Inn advertisements that his daughter mentioned in her tribute. Television aficionados of the 1990s will recognise Mull from his work on Roseanne, where he played the titular characters boss Leon Carp, or in Sabrina the Teenage Witch, where he played Principal Willard Kraft. Mull also appeared on the critically acclaimed satirical sitcom Arrested Development, playing hapless private detective Gene Parmesan. He guest starred in numerous other well-known television shows, including The Simpsons, Family Guy, Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, The Golden Girls and Two and a Half Men. Mull was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for a four-episode appearance he made on HBOs political satire Veep in 2016. Born in Chicago to an actress and a carpenter, Mull began his show business career as a songwriter and became known as a musical comedian. He opened for Frank Zappa and Bruce Springsteen at numerous live gigs in the early 1970s. He also studied painting and graduated in 1965 from the Rhode Island School of Design with a Bachelor of Fine Arts. In a 2013 interview with the A.V. Club, he said of his acting career that every painter I know has a day job. Theyre either teaching art at some college or driving a cab. I just happened to luck into a day job thats extraordinary and a lot of fun and buys a lot of paint, he said. As well as his daughter, Maggie, a TV writer, he leaves his wife, Wendy Haas, an actor and composer whom he wed in 1982."
Sadness as two Shropshire Barclays branches close for good,"The banks in Ludlow and Bridgnorth had suffered dwindling transactions in recent years, the financial giant said. Ludlow MP Philip Dunne said the bank was abandoning rural communities, adding it meant there would be no Barclays branches in his constituency. The area lost its branches in Craven Arms in 2017, and Much Wenlock and Church Stretton in 2018. The next nearest are in Telford or Shrewsbury. ""Both Ludlow and Bridgnorth have a significant population of elderly and vulnerable people, who may not use the branch daily, but rely on a local branch presence when they need help and advice,"" Conservative Mr Dunne said. Barclays said the number of counter transactions at both sites had gone down in the two years to March 2020, with 80% of Ludlow customers and 83% of Bridgnorth customers choosing to bank in other ways, such as online or by telephone. At Ludlow, only 251 customers had been exclusively using the branch for their banking, with 113 in Bridgnorth, the company said. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Sadness at former M&S building demolition,"Plans to demolish an ""art deco"" former Marks and Spencer store are ""dreadful"", say locals and veteran staff. Labour-run Sunderland City Council, which owns the site, is proposing to flatten part or all of the building to make way for new offices and retail space. Chief executive Patrick Melia said demolition was ""necessary"" for the next phase of redevelopment in the city centre. The retailer closed the store in May because of ""changing customer habits"" and opened a larger outlet at a retail park in Washington. The building on High Street West was built for the retailer several decades ago and became one of its ""flagship"" stores in north-east England. Brenda Stobbart, who worked at the store in the 1960s, said it was disappointing that a ""proud"" building could not be retained. ""I think it's dreadful - its a lovely building, it has been there as long as I can remember,"" she told the BBC. ""Everybody [staff] had their own little shop [inside], you had your own counter. ""You were responsible for replenishing the stock, cleaning, and doing everything, everyone had their own little till. ""It was a proud place to work."" She said it was one of the more attractive buildings in the city, and demolition would be detrimental to the city's history. The building was due to be retained as part of the council's masterplan, published in October 2020, to regenerate the city. But as Marks and Spencer, which still has the lease until 2027, was the only tenant, it is no longer occupied. Opposition parties have accused the council of ""kicking out"" the retailer to progress with the plans, a claim denied by Mr Melia and the authority's Labour leader. Heather Fagan, Wearside Liberal Democrats deputy leader, said plans to demolish the site were a ""shocking revelation"" and ""beyond belief"". Meanwhile, councillor Dominic McDonough from the Sunderland Conservatives - which recently attempted to have the building achieve listed status - said retail had been ""almost completely wiped out"" and ""things are looking bleak for shoppers"". But recently appointed leader of Sunderland Labour Michael Mordey, said the plans would ""better connect the heart of the city"" to the ongoing Riverside development. Mr Melia echoed Mr Mordey's comments and said the council was adapting its plans following a ""long-term decision"" by M&S to change its retail strategy. He said: ""The world of how we shop is very different and we have to reflect that. ""What we're trying to create is a city centre that still brings us together, to socialise and interact with others, but one with new experiences."" He said there were plans to start the demolition of buildings along High Street West to continue regeneration this autumn and the council was working with developers and existing and new tenants. He added the authority would not rule out keeping part of the building's façade, but said there was a ""planning process"" to go through. ""If we think there is value in retaining some of that façade, then we will do... but certainly, the use of the building and nature of it will have to change.""

School crossing branded 'a death trap',"Parents have called for action to protect schoolchildren from a road crossing they have labelled a ""death trap"". Middleton St George residents have urged Darlington Borough Council to move the crossing point on Middleton Lane to a safer area. They say pupils at St George's Church of England Academy are at risk of speeding drivers and fear a child could be seriously injured. A council spokesperson said the authority took road safety ""very seriously"" but that it had been unable to find a replacement for a lollipop lady currently off work. Parents and children have had to queue along a narrow pavement and walk through traffic in her absence. One person told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: ""Its a death trap and an accident waiting to happen. ""Were very lucky that no-one has been badly injured."" Borough councillor Colin Pease said he had ""put forward several potential solutions to highways at Darlington Borough Council and all have been rejected"". ""The crossing is in the wrong place and is clearly not designated as a crossing,"" he added. ""I even paid for Children Crossing  Keep Clear signs out of my own pocket which, although the crossing patrol said they were a great help, highways said they should be removed in case there was a claim. ""This has not gone down well with residents as they feel the council is more interested in avoiding potential claims than child safety. ""I continue to revisit this problem until a suitable solution is provided and funded."" The council said: ""Road safety is something we take very seriously and we will always try to support parents and families to ensure children get to school safely. ""We have three mobile school crossing patrol staff, whose role is to cover absences.  Unfortunately, all three are assigned elsewhere at the moment.""

School gates planned to stop urinating racegoers,"Rachael Maskell, as York Central Labour MP, raised concerns in 2022 about people getting into the site, telling the Commons the behaviour of inebriated racegoers posed a safeguarding risk to pupils. The school is split across two sites, with the Lower site for years seven to nine on Nunnery Lane. The Upper Site, for years 10, 11 and the schools sixth form, is in Mill Mount on the way to York Racecourse from the railway station. The application stated the installation of fencing and railings would have no direct impact on the schools listed buildings, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Ms Squires letter stated the plans would deal with the issues in an appropriate and proportionate way. She said: The Upper Site has a number of vulnerabilities around security and safeguarding. Ensuring children and young people are able to learn in a safe environment is an important priority. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

School records 42 cases of pupils accessing roof,"People living near the school told the BBC that they had seen children climbing on the roofs.

School takes pupils on road safety walk,"""There's a lot of fast-moving traffic here, we are very close to the dual carriageways,"" said Mr Bradney. The lessons had included not getting too close to the kerb when waiting to cross the road, not squeezing between cars, and not taking for granted how fast vehicles were travelling. ""We've done the interactive chalk and talk in the class, and then we go out and about and put it into practice,"" he added. ""It makes us more confident to cross roads by ourselves,"" said one pupil.

Schools bus service gets extended council funding,"Connexions reduced the number of buses on the route from four to three in October owing to a rise in operating costs and passenger numbers dropping below pre-coronavirus levels. The council has agreed to give the bus company more time to draw up a workable timetable. Flaxman Croft and West Nooks at either end of the route will be the focus of support, the LDRS said, and the service will continue to be funded to run every half hour until 21 July. Connexions says pupils at Joseph Rowntree, Huntington, All Saints and York College all use the service. The councils decision said the reliability issues were affecting the whole route and could not have been foreseen in February when they decided the original funding deadline. It said quick action was needed because if it was scrapped, most of Copmanthorpe could be left without a bus service. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

Seven takeaways from BBC Newcastle's election debate,"Among the sparkiest exchanges was a clash between Conservative Luke Allan Holmes and Labours Joe Morris over the issue of poverty. The Conservative said his government had protected households and incomes - and boosted communities with levelling up cash. Labour said there had been a lack of investment in public services for 14 years. Reform UKs Andrew Husband said his party would lift the tax-free income to £20,000, bringing seven million people out of poverty instantly. The Greens Rachel Featherstone said they would invest in home insultation to cut fuel bills and bring in a minimum wage of £15 per hour. Liberal Democrat Ron Beadle said the government should be ashamed of its record of increasing poverty, and his party would abolish the two-child benefit cap and offer free school meals to all primary school children. The tone of the debate was passionate without being aggressive. So what did we learn? Here are seven takeaways. Ron Beadle highlighted the Lib Dems' manifesto promise that cancer patients be seen within 62 days, adding: ""As a cancer patient myself I know how important this is."" Reform UKs Andrew Husband said one of the biggest issues was staff retention -  and its policies around tax breaks for NHS workers earnings would help. Labours Joe Morris insisted his party would be able to deliver an extra 40,000 GP appointments a week. He said: ""We need to start by getting the NHS back on its feet. Our manifesto is what we can achieve in five years."" Conservative Luke Allan Holmes praised our doctors and nurses for their work during the pandemic and in the time since. He outlined the partys commitment to the NHS Long Term Plan, adding: ""We havent met out targets over the past few years because of Covid but we have invested a lot of money in the NHS."" The Greens Rachel Featherstone said simply ""other parties dont plan to invest enough"". She argued they could - with ""a modest tax on the super-rich."" Thousands of North East pupils had their studies disrupted after so-called crumbing concrete used in school buildings - known as Raac - was judged unsafe. And there were already complaints that too many schools were left with outdated, leaky and poorly insulated structures. The question of who was to blame divides the parties. Labour said the government has under-invested in schools for many years, but the government insists it has been rebuilding and improving schools across the region. As for the problems caused by Raac at St Leonards School in Durham  raised by a listener - Conservative Luke Allan Holmes said Tory councillors and ministers had pushed hard to ensure pupils were able to move to temporary buildings to limit disruption. The parties all believe there will be improvements  as local leaders have been granted more powers to make changes with the North East mayoral authority. Conservative Luke Allan Holmes argued that cancelling HS2 means more money for transport projects across the North, and pointed to the new Northumberland Line. He said public transport is ""one thing we are well on top of"". Rachel Featherstone for the Greens said more money needed to be invested to make it ""more reliable and frequent, and more attractive than the car"". Liberal Democrat Ron Beadle blamed privatisation for transport problems in the North East, and expressed hope the new mayoral authority will have the power to make changes. Reform UKs Andrew Husband argued that scrapping HS2 is an ""easy fix"" to allocate the money elsewhere. And for Labour, Joe Morris said it would make it easier for communities to have input into their bus routes. He pointed out Kim McGuinness, Labour's mayor for the North East, wanted to bring in more integrated transport and will have an easier time doing so with a Labour government. The parties disagreed on how to improve water quality in our rivers. Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives ruled out nationalising water companies due to costs. However, Rachel Featherstone of the Green Party said it would take water companies back into public hands, adding we should not be giving them ""a single penny more"". Andrew Husband, for Reform UK, said it would bring water companies 50% back into public ownership, and ""the profits should go back into the taxpayers pockets"". Liberal Democrat Ron Beadle said water firms would be changed into ""public benefit companies"" and it would replace and ""toughen up"" the regulator. While the parties may disagree on many topics, there were areas of consensus. On the issue of social care, all parties accept more investment is needed. Liberal Democrat Ron Beadle said: ""This is where the Lib Dems and Reform UK agree - it needs to not be a party political issue."" Rachel Featherstone for the Greens added ""in the spirit of co-operation"" it agreed with the Lib Dems plan on personal care, adding ""we are committed to providing enough money for that"". Eight years after the EU referendum, the politicians were asked whether Brexit has been a success or not. Reform UKs Andrew Husband said people are blaming things on Brexit rather than a three-year pandemic, but argued Brexit had not ""stopped"" people from working or studying in Europe. Conservative Luke Allan Holmes said Brexit has been a huge success, adding: ""We are now back in charge of the United Kingdom and were not surrendering to Brussels."" Joe Morris for Labour said Brexit has damaged sheep farmers in Northumberland, adding: ""We need to get on a better standing so that farmers... can get on a better footing with trading with the EU."" Green Rachel Featherstone proudly declared the party's ""pro-EU"" credentials, adding it would look to re-join ""as soon as possible"". Liberal Democrat Ron Beadle said Brexit had left international student numbers in Gateshead and Newcastle ""plummeting"" - and added it was ""committed"" to restoring the UK's relationship with the EU because ""stopping people coming massively impacts our influence in the world"".

Sewage 'nuisance' complaint made against water firm,"Campaigners said the complaint was the first of its kind in the UK against a water company. Save Windermere alleged more than 100 incidences of sewage being discharged into and around the river Rothay in Ambleside over a 13-month period amounted to a statutory nuisance. It said the discharges were in addition to data which alleged there were at least 234 days with illegal early spills of untreated sewage by United Utilities into Windermere and the surrounding catchment between 2018 and 2022  including 75 days where illegal spilling occurred at Ambleside Wastewater Treatment Works. Campaigners pointed to Section 79(1) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which said that a statutory nuisance could occur from ""accumulations or deposits"", which would stand due to the accumulations of suspended solids in untreated sewage, Save Windermere said. United Utilities said it had invested £75m upgrading wastewater treatment sites, pumping stations and sewers around Windermere over the last two decades. ""Total phosphorus in Windermere has reduced by 30% as a direct result of that investment,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have already started work on a further £41m of investment into the Windermere catchment between now and 2030 to reduce storm overflow operation at Elterwater, Hawkshead, Ambleside and Near Sawrey. ""This will reduce spills by 50% on 2022 figures and is expected to reduce total phosphorus by a further 4% and 8% in the two basins of Windermere.""

Shirt makers urged to share stories for exhibition,"Stories from former workers at a shirt maker in Wakefield are wanted for an exhibition on how the company changed men's fashion. Clothing firm Double Two was established by Isaak Donner and Frank Myer who both fled war-torn Europe in 1940 to set up shop in the city. The business, which still operates, became known worldwide for its attachable spare collars, the first man-made fibre garment and the first non-iron shirt. Wakefield Museum curator John Whitaker said staff hoped to collect memories from workers at the firm, which at its peak employed 1,500 in the city and a further 600 around Britain. Mr Whitaker said such was the size of the workforce, the company had its own bus service which would collect workers, many of them the wives and daughters of miners who lived in villages across the district. He said: We are hoping that this is going to attract loads of worker stories that we can collect. Its been great so far. We have had so much feedback. ""A lot of people who used to work there have come to see it and we are having a special celebration night for them. We want to send the message out far and wide and get lots of people who worked there to be involved and give us all those memories."" The business started out in a small fourth-floor corner room in a building in Kirkgate in the city centre. By 1946, it had taken over the entire building, transforming it into a vast shirt manufacturing facility that became a key player in the men's shirt market. Having found the majority of men returning from World War Two had become accustomed to wearing loose-collar shirts rather than a stiff collar, Mr Donner introduced a patent that his family had developed prior to the war. The Double Two shirt took its name from its unique selling point - each shirt came with replaceable collars and cuffs to extend the life of the garment. The company also pioneered work with man-made fibres and the exhibition features the world's first synthetic shirt, created in Wakefield in 1950. The display also charts the company's fortunes as menswear trends changed throughout the 20th Century. It follows the evolution of materials and designs through an array of shirts in different colours and bold patterns. The event is part of Our Year, a year-long programme of activities to celebrate the districts heritage. Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly known as Twitter) and Instagram.

Shopkeepers urge action over 'spiralling' shoplifting,"The shop security camera captures it all. A man walks in, takes two bottles of gin and simply walks out without paying - all  right in front of a member of staff on the till. This is Peter Saleems business in Blyth, Northumberland. It has been in the family for more than 20 years. He shows me more CCTV footage showing one of his staff grappling with a shoplifter trying to clear a shelf of stock. Shoplifting, he says, is a daily occurrence. ""The problem has really spiralled out of control,"" he says. ""Theyre career criminals these chaps. The shoplifters are well aware theyre not going to be prosecuted, theyre not even going to be pulled in for it. ""We need increased numbers of police - so if somebody steals they get pulled in for it and they get prosecuted."" According to Home Office recorded crime figures, there were more than 36,000 cases of shoplifting in the North East, Cumbria and North Yorkshire in 2023. The figure went up by 46% in the North East in a year - the highest percentage increase outside London. But business owners like Peter reckon those numbers underestimate the scale of the problem, with police sometimes offering ""zero"" response to shoplifting - merely issuing a crime number. The Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 says a theft of under £200 is a summary offence with a maximum penalty of £70. Neeraj Bedi, who runs a general store in Newcastle city centre, says his staff are ""constantly on edge"". ""We are just waiting for the next incident to happen,"" he says. ""If we have a major incident it takes 45 minutes for the police to come and that's on 999."" Neeraj wants a commitment from politicians during the election that they will tackle the issue. ""I genuinely want to hear from them that we dont have to live in fear... that youre willing to put more police on our streets,"" he says. However, criminologist professor Mike Rowe, from Northumbria University, warns just increasing police numbers might not be the answer. ""You could have 5,000 more police, you could have 50 or 100,000 more police,"" he says. ""My question would be, how are we going to deploy them? How are they going to be organised? ""I think there's also a real problem with people stealing for need rather than greed - people who are stealing because they can't afford to feed themselves and their families in other ways."" Northumbria Police says it is responding to shoplifting by ""actively targeting prolific offenders"" and it follows ""all reasonable lines of inquiry."" How the parties plan to tackle shoplifting and anti-social behaviour: Labour says it will ""scrap the effective immunity for some shoplifting offences"" and ""create a new specific offence for assaults on shopworkers"". The Conservatives say they will recruit 8,000 more police officers, giving ""every neighbourhood an additional police officer"". The Liberal Democrats say they will invest more in ""frontline policing"" by ""scrapping Police and Crime Commissioners and replacing them with Local Police Boards, made up of councillors and representatives from relevant local groups"". The Green Party says it will ""repair and renew our crumbling court system with a £2.5bn investment"". Reform UK pledges 40,000 ""new frontline"" police officers over a five-year period.

Shoppers 'sad and frustrated' over M&S closures,"Shoppers have described sadness and frustration at the closure of two Marks and Spencer (M&S) stores in the North East. The retailer's Sunderland store and Hexham's Maidens Walk ceased trading on Friday. The retailer said the move was prompted by ""changing"" shopping habits and added it had invested £13m in its North East stores over the past year. However residents in Sunderland said it had been ""one of the worst things to happen"" to the city and worry for the high street's future. Meanwhile, a bid has been launched to achieve listed status for the Sunderland store. M&S announced its plan to shut the branch in January, with a new, larger shop at the Washington Galleries set to open. Historic England confirmed it had received an application for listing the store in the city centre, which was made by Sunderland Conservatives. Councillor Lyall Reed said listing would protect the building from ""inconsiderate changes to its Art Deco architecture"". Neil, 74, and Norma, 84, from Sunderland said it was a ""crying shame"" and the ""end of era"" as it followed the closures of flagship department stores like Binns and Joplings. ""I feel very emotional, its been here all my life,"" Norma continued. ""We come here every week, its certainly going to change how often I come into the town centre, I wont be coming in as often which is sad."" Denise Ward, from Ryhope, said Sunderland ""was going down hill"". ""Weve lost Marksys, what else have we got? Its been here for years and now weve got nothing."" ""This is one of the worst things to happen to Sunderland,"" Alan Crawford, from Pallion, said. ""You cant just keep moving stores to retail parks because old people cant get there, they should stay in the city centre,"" the 74-year-old explained. Meanwhile in Hexham, residents previously spoke of being ""devastated"" and it being the ""another nail in the coffin"" for the town. It sparked concerns for the future of the high street and main stores for shoppers. The stores are among 110 to close across the country as part of a major overhaul by M&S implemented over five years. Its Middlesbrough shop closed in 2023 after 122 years of trade.

Shoppers dismayed as Bradford M&S ceases trading,"M&S has had premises at The Broadway since the £260m site opened in 2015, prior to that it was located in Darley Street. Customers shopping at the store in its final days said the closure would make shopping for food and clothes ""very difficult for many people"". Ian Scholes, 68, said: ""We come to this store every week and shop for my wife's mother. She's got limited mobility, she walks with a walking aid, so we do all the shopping for her ready meals here. ""We're going to be using more petrol and more time going further afield."" Carol Inn, 63, said she would miss the cafe, describing it as a ""safe space"". She said she did not know of any other cafes where older people could get the same feeling, saying: ""You could go in there and sit on your own; it was just nice.""

For the people, for the countryside, for what we do. I can't see why anyone would want to live anywhere else,"" she added. North Shropshire MP Helen Morgan's Commons motion, spoke of admiring ""the strong community spirit which is characteristic of Salopians"". The day has not traditionally been as widely celebrated as some county days elsewhere in England. But in the age of social media, some local firms used it as an opportunity to promote their wares with special offers.

Sir Keir Starmer wants more housing in Yorkshire,"He told the BBC: ""Yorkshire has such beautiful countryside and we will protect it; but at the same time we have to build the houses that we need.""

He added: ""We cannot go on with delays like that [15 years]. It means that many people across Yorkshire, perhaps first-time buyers, are not able to get on the properly ladder because there is not enough housing and they can't afford it."" Another issue in York is an abundance of short-term lets and Airbnb properties, which push up rents while reducing the supply of housing stock for permanent residents. Sir Keir said: ""We need a tighter framework - there's too much bidding going on and too many people taking big deposits from buyers who want to rent or let, and conditions aren't what they should be. ""We have put on the table a very strong plan for renters."" When it was put to Sir Keir that his party was ""well ahead"" in the polls, he told the BBC: ""Every single vote has to be earned, no seat has been won and polls do not predict the future. ""What we're doing is taking our positive message to as many doorsteps as we can, saying this is a chance for change."" When asked if any doubts ""creep into his mind"" on the campaign trail, he said: ""In the end you have to focus on the general election itself and the day people go into the ballot box and make their choice.

Six LGBTQ+ destinations around the world,"Even though it's Pride season, it can still be a potentially nerve-racking time for LGBTQ+ travellers. While LGBTQ+ rights and visibility have increased greatly in the last decade, so have some increasingly intimidating threats, as the community continues to battle international customs, legality and cultural norms. Case in point: in May, the US State Department issued a worldwide travel warning about the ""increased potential for foreign terrorist organisation-inspired violence against LGBTQI+ persons and events."" It recommends staying alert in locations ""frequented by tourists, including Pride celebrations and venues frequented by LGBTQI+ persons."" Matthieu Jost, CEO of LGBTQ+ accommodation app misterb&b, which has 1.3 million registered users, advises queer tourists to ""travel and stay like a local, particularly in areas you're not sure about, and get advice from LGBTQ+ residents before you even step foot in a new travel destination."" Even in less LGBTQ+-friendly places, Jost maintains that ""LGBTQ+ travellers often aren't as deterred to visit as you would expect, and that's likely due to local gay hosts as well as allies within the community itself."" Due vigilance aside, there are still hundreds of queer-friendly destinations around the world, from Berlin to Mykonos and Amsterdam to Madrid. But for every Brighton and San Francisco that are famous for their inclusive culture, there many other queer-friendly destinations you may not think of, such as Torremolinos, Spain and Malta. This list of six LGBTQ+-friendly destinations is based on several sources, including the ILGA-Europe Rainbow Index, which ranks European countries on LGBTQ+ equality; its parent site, ILGA, which compiles global rankings; and Asher Fergusson's 2023 report on LGBTQ+ travel, which involved 400 hours of research and examines many factors related to LGBTQ+ safety  from protections against discrimination to same-sex marriage  in more than 200 countries. ""It was important for us to cover this topic because it so greatly affects so many travellers,"" said Lyric Fergusson, who runs the travel safety site with her partner, Asher. ""Unfortunately, the harsh reality is that the majority of the world is still far from safe for LGBTQ+ people. But because laws are always being revised, it's our mission to update this list at least once a year."" Here are six LGBTQ+-friendly destinations on five continents proving that despite recent warnings, much of the world remains an open, welcoming place. Standing proudly at #1 on the Asher Fergusson list is Canada, which decriminalised homosexual acts back in 1969 and same-sex marriage in 2005. While its largest city, Toronto, hosts one the world's largest Pride celebrations (running through 30 June 2024), Montreal's queer scene is pioneering: back in 1918, this was where the first-known queer magazine in North America was published, Les Mouches Fantastiques. The epicentre of the city's LGBTQ+ scene, The Village, in Ville-Marie, is the province of Quebec's largest gay neighbourhood. Its main drag, Saint Catherine Street East, is home to a buzzy strip of bars like Le Stud, Aigle Noir and Complexe Sky. Non-binary, queer women and trans visitors should also check out parties such as Elle Lui and Sweet Like Honey. ""The queer community is well-mixed between anglophones and francophones, so I guess some kind of richness comes with having most of our events bilingual,"" said Theo Tessier from the Montreal LGBTQ+ Community Centre, established in 1988, whose library, she explained, holds ""more than 20,000 books, essays, documentaries and films."" Meanwhile Montreal's Gay Archives, which is open to the public, contain thousands of books, zines, posters and periodicals. Thailand legalised same-sex activity back in 1956 and has laws that ban discrimination over gender identity and sexual orientation. What's more, the same-sex marriage bill was just passed last week, making Thailand the only South-East Asian country to recognise same-sex unions. However, since same-sex marriages still weren't legal in 2023, the Asher Fergusson report placed it at #62 on its most recent list. ""And yet, Bangkok is truly one of the most LGBTQ+-friendly destinations in the world"" for travellers, said Blue Satittammanoon, founder of White Party Bangkok, an annual event attracting 32,000 attendees from 93 countries. ""It's not only the largest gay dance festival in Asia,"" he said, ""but also the biggest gay New Year's Eve in the world."" For those visiting, Satittammanoon recommended neighbourhoods like Silom, home to venues such as ""DJ Station, G Bangkok and The Stranger Bar, plus new clubs like Beef and Rush"". As Satittammanoon said, the key to Bangkok being a ""haven for LGBTQ travellers [is] Thailand's [increasingly] progressive stance on LGBTQ rights, coupled with the warm hospitality that is so deeply ingrained in Thai culture."" Belgium came in at third place on the ILGA-Europe Rainbow Index (after Malta at #1, and Iceland at #2), and #9 on the Asher Fergusson list. Astonishingly, same-sex activity was legalised here in 1795, and it was the second country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage back in 2003, after the Netherlands. While Brussels is sometimes regarded as a little buttoned-up, locals say its LGBTQ+ scene is second to none. The main hub of its queer scene is located on curving thoroughfare Rue De Marche au Charbon and its surrounding streets. Popular bars include historic spot Le Belgica, trading since the 1980s; Station BXL; and quirky bar Homo Erectus, home to drag artist Paula Roid. ""We're far ahead in terms of LGBTQ+ rights, whether it concerns queer parenthood or trans-identity,"" Roid said. ""Our queer artistic scene includes Kitsch and Cheap at The Agenda, a must-see non-binary bar, and Playback, which opens the doors of so-called straight places in order to raise awareness of our community."" Few people realise that same-sex relations were legalised in Mexico back in 1871. And even though Mexico City legalised same-sex marriages back in 2010, and the country's final state legalised same-sex unions in 2022, the country makes only #42 in Asher Fergusson's travel safety report due to issues around adoption and hate crimes. However, for more than 60 years, the Pacific coast resort town of Puerto Vallarta in the state of Jalisco has been an LGBTQ+ destination. In fact, by some estimates, roughly one-third of all tourists to the so-called ""San Francisco of Mexico"" are members of the LGBTQ+ community. As Omar Eduardo Rivera Aguayo of the Mexican LGBTQ+ rights organisation Yaaj said: ""In a country with one of the highest rates of hate crimes against the sexual diversity population, Puerto Vallarta stands out in an act of rebellion and acceptance as one of the most LGBTQ+-friendly destinations in the world."" Aguayo recommends the ""iconic"" cobblestoned gay-bourhood called the Romantic Zone, adding there are ""more than 40 bars and hotels exclusive to our diverse community,"" including long-running Palm Cabaret, which has hosted tribute shows to queer icons. A respectable #21 on the Asher Fergusson report, Australia's newly crowned largest city is home to the country's first-ever purpose-built LGBTQ+ space, Victorian Pride Centre, which opened in 2021 (and houses the queer bookshop Hares & Hyenas). nan The state of Victoria is regarded as the country's most progressive, with Melbourne home to one of Australia's first queer political organisations, Daughters of Bilitis (Australia), formed in 1970. Key annual events include the Midsumma Festival and Melbourne Queer Film Festival (founded in 1991). Areas like Windsor, Fitzroy and St Kilda are all LGBTQ+ hubs, the latter home to the Prince Public Bar, a queer haunt since 1937. An essential newer opening is Beans Bar. More like this:  The tiny European island of tolerance  Where Spain's gay rights movement began  How Brighton became an epicentre of freedom ""I like to think Melbourne is so queer-friendly due to how multicultural we are and our diverse backgrounds,"" said owner Beca Pressing. ""This has helped us form a community that is accepting. We're not the first lesbian bar, but we are the first lesbian, trans, non-binary and neurodivergent bar: our aim is to create a safe and inclusive space for those who are most disadvantaged in the community."" Brazil is listed at #33 on the Asher Ferguson report, due to ""the recent increase in violence towards the LGBTQ+ (especially trans community)."" Despite this, same-sex couples have enjoyed equal rights since 2013, while in 2019, laws were passed banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2023, Booking.com placed Sao Paulo at #1 on its list of LGBTQ+-friendly destinations in Brazil, while also naming it as one of the world's Top LGBTQ+ Friendly Destinations for 2024. Sao Paulo's Pride festival (which started in 1997) is known as the largest in the world. Queer-friendly neighbourhoods include the bohemian Vila Madalena and upscale Jardins. An important LGBTQ+ thoroughfare is Frei Caneca Street, with dozens of shops and bars, while lesbian and queer female-friendly Espeto Bambu is in the artsy Pinheiros neighbourhood. And after a year-and-a-half closure, the Museum of Sexual Diversity, the first of its kind in Latin America, recently reopened. ""This physical expansion reflects the expansion of horizons that we aim for,"" explained director Carlos Gradim. ""It's the first step in a series of cultural and educational activities, creating important connections and dialogues for society: a sublime moment for us."" -- nan If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter  a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Here are six LGBTQ+-friendly destinations on five continents proving that despite recent warnings, much of the world remains an open, welcoming place. Standing proudly at #1 on the Asher Fergusson list is Canada, which decriminalised homosexual acts back in 1969 and same-sex marriage in 2005. While its largest city, Toronto, hosts one the world's largest Pride celebrations (running through 30 June 2024), Montreal's queer scene is pioneering: back in 1918, this was where the first-known queer magazine in North America was published, Les Mouches Fantastiques. The epicentre of the city's LGBTQ+ scene, The Village, in Ville-Marie, is the province of Quebec's largest gay neighbourhood. Its main drag, Saint Catherine Street East, is home to a buzzy strip of bars like Le Stud, Aigle Noir and Complexe Sky. Non-binary, queer women and trans visitors should also check out parties such as Elle Lui and Sweet Like Honey. ""The queer community is well-mixed between anglophones and francophones, so I guess some kind of richness comes with having most of our events bilingual,"" said Theo Tessier from the Montreal LGBTQ+ Community Centre, established in 1988, whose library, she explained, holds ""more than 20,000 books, essays, documentaries and films."" Meanwhile Montreal's Gay Archives, which is open to the public, contain thousands of books, zines, posters and periodicals. Thailand legalised same-sex activity back in 1956 and has laws that ban discrimination over gender identity and sexual orientation. What's more, the same-sex marriage bill was just passed last week, making Thailand the only South-East Asian country to recognise same-sex unions. However, since same-sex marriages still weren't legal in 2023, the Asher Fergusson report placed it at #62 on its most recent list. ""And yet, Bangkok is truly one of the most LGBTQ+-friendly destinations in the world"" for travellers, said Blue Satittammanoon, founder of White Party Bangkok, an annual event attracting 32,000 attendees from 93 countries. ""It's not only the largest gay dance festival in Asia,"" he said, ""but also the biggest gay New Year's Eve in the world."" For those visiting, Satittammanoon recommended neighbourhoods like Silom, home to venues such as ""DJ Station, G Bangkok and The Stranger Bar, plus new clubs like Beef and Rush"". As Satittammanoon said, the key to Bangkok being a ""haven for LGBTQ travellers [is] Thailand's [increasingly] progressive stance on LGBTQ rights, coupled with the warm hospitality that is so deeply ingrained in Thai culture."" Belgium came in at third place on the ILGA-Europe Rainbow Index (after Malta at #1, and Iceland at #2), and #9 on the Asher Fergusson list. Astonishingly, same-sex activity was legalised here in 1795, and it was the second country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage back in 2003, after the Netherlands. While Brussels is sometimes regarded as a little buttoned-up, locals say its LGBTQ+ scene is second to none. The main hub of its queer scene is located on curving thoroughfare Rue De Marche au Charbon and its surrounding streets. Popular bars include historic spot Le Belgica, trading since the 1980s; Station BXL; and quirky bar Homo Erectus, home to drag artist Paula Roid. ""We're far ahead in terms of LGBTQ+ rights, whether it concerns queer parenthood or trans-identity,"" Roid said. ""Our queer artistic scene includes Kitsch and Cheap at The Agenda, a must-see non-binary bar, and Playback, which opens the doors of so-called straight places in order to raise awareness of our community."" Few people realise that same-sex relations were legalised in Mexico back in 1871. And even though Mexico City legalised same-sex marriages back in 2010, and the country's final state legalised same-sex unions in 2022, the country makes only #42 in Asher Fergusson's travel safety report due to issues around adoption and hate crimes. However, for more than 60 years, the Pacific coast resort town of Puerto Vallarta in the state of Jalisco has been an LGBTQ+ destination. In fact, by some estimates, roughly one-third of all tourists to the so-called ""San Francisco of Mexico"" are members of the LGBTQ+ community. As Omar Eduardo Rivera Aguayo of the Mexican LGBTQ+ rights organisation Yaaj said: ""In a country with one of the highest rates of hate crimes against the sexual diversity population, Puerto Vallarta stands out in an act of rebellion and acceptance as one of the most LGBTQ+-friendly destinations in the world."" Aguayo recommends the ""iconic"" cobblestoned gay-bourhood called the Romantic Zone, adding there are ""more than 40 bars and hotels exclusive to our diverse community,"" including long-running Palm Cabaret, which has hosted tribute shows to queer icons. A respectable #21 on the Asher Fergusson report, Australia's newly crowned largest city is home to the country's first-ever purpose-built LGBTQ+ space, Victorian Pride Centre, which opened in 2021 (and houses the queer bookshop Hares & Hyenas). nan The state of Victoria is regarded as the country's most progressive, with Melbourne home to one of Australia's first queer political organisations, Daughters of Bilitis (Australia), formed in 1970. Key annual events include the Midsumma Festival and Melbourne Queer Film Festival (founded in 1991). Areas like Windsor, Fitzroy and St Kilda are all LGBTQ+ hubs, the latter home to the Prince Public Bar, a queer haunt since 1937. An essential newer opening is Beans Bar. More like this:  The tiny European island of tolerance  Where Spain's gay rights movement began  How Brighton became an epicentre of freedom ""I like to think Melbourne is so queer-friendly due to how multicultural we are and our diverse backgrounds,"" said owner Beca Pressing. ""This has helped us form a community that is accepting. We're not the first lesbian bar, but we are the first lesbian, trans, non-binary and neurodivergent bar: our aim is to create a safe and inclusive space for those who are most disadvantaged in the community."" Brazil is listed at #33 on the Asher Ferguson report, due to ""the recent increase in violence towards the LGBTQ+ (especially trans community)."" Despite this, same-sex couples have enjoyed equal rights since 2013, while in 2019, laws were passed banning discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2023, Booking.com placed Sao Paulo at #1 on its list of LGBTQ+-friendly destinations in Brazil, while also naming it as one of the world's Top LGBTQ+ Friendly Destinations for 2024. Sao Paulo's Pride festival (which started in 1997) is known as the largest in the world. Queer-friendly neighbourhoods include the bohemian Vila Madalena and upscale Jardins. An important LGBTQ+ thoroughfare is Frei Caneca Street, with dozens of shops and bars, while lesbian and queer female-friendly Espeto Bambu is in the artsy Pinheiros neighbourhood. And after a year-and-a-half closure, the Museum of Sexual Diversity, the first of its kind in Latin America, recently reopened. ""This physical expansion reflects the expansion of horizons that we aim for,"" explained director Carlos Gradim. ""It's the first step in a series of cultural and educational activities, creating important connections and dialogues for society: a sublime moment for us."" -- nan If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter  a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week. For more Travel stories from the BBC, follow us on Facebook, X and Instagram. nan nan Beyond famous hotspots like Brighton and Berlin, these are some of the most accepting places for LGBTQ+ travellers to visit. Even though it's Pride season, it can still be a potentially nerve-racking time for LGBTQ+ travellers. While LGBTQ+ rights and visibility have increased greatly in the last decade, so have some increasingly intimidating threats, as the community continues to battle international customs, legality and cultural norms. Case in point: in May, the US State Department issued a worldwide travel warning about the ""increased potential for foreign terrorist organisation-inspired violence against LGBTQI+ persons and events."" It recommends staying alert in locations ""frequented by tourists, including Pride celebrations and venues frequented by LGBTQI+ persons."" Matthieu Jost, CEO of LGBTQ+ accommodation app misterb&b, which has 1.3 million registered users, advises queer tourists to ""travel and stay like a local, particularly in areas you're not sure about, and get advice from LGBTQ+ residents before you even step foot in a new travel destination."" Even in less LGBTQ+-friendly places, Jost maintains that ""LGBTQ+ travellers often aren't as deterred to visit as you would expect, and that's likely due to local gay hosts as well as allies within the community itself."" Due vigilance aside, there are still hundreds of queer-friendly destinations around the world, from Berlin to Mykonos and Amsterdam to Madrid. But for every Brighton and San Francisco that are famous for their inclusive culture, there many other queer-friendly destinations you may not think of, such as Torremolinos, Spain and Malta. This list of six LGBTQ+-friendly destinations is based on several sources, including the ILGA-Europe Rainbow Index, which ranks European countries on LGBTQ+ equality; its parent site, ILGA, which compiles global rankings; and Asher Fergusson's 2023 report on LGBTQ+ travel, which involved 400 hours of research and examines many factors related to LGBTQ+ safety  from protections against discrimination to same-sex marriage  in more than 200 countries. ""It was important for us to cover this topic because it so greatly affects so many travellers,"" said Lyric Fergusson, who runs the travel safety site with her partner, Asher.

Six takeaways from the Biden-Trump presidential debate,"American voters watched the two main presidential contenders for the November 5 election brawl it out on Thursday night in the first public debate before the contest. Former US President Donald Trump, 78, hurled hyperbole at President Joe Biden, 81, who seemed to lose his train of thought during the debate at the CNN headquarters in Atlanta. The two oldest presidential hopefuls in US history clashed over immigration, abortion and even golf. Here are six key takeaways from the first US presidential debate: Biden, who already faces criticism over his age was unable to match the energy of Trump, who is only three years his junior. The incumbent president resorted to raspy rambling and appeared to struggle with articulating his words. At one point, he referred to âbillionairesâ as âtrillionairesâ before going back to correct himself. Biden made some robust criticism of Trumpâs leadership during COVID-19 and its impact on the economy, and mocked some of Trumpâs responses to COVID-19 safeguards at the time. âJust inject a little bleach into your arm, and youâll be alright,â he said. However, his tone fell flat against his more bombastic opponent, especially during the early stages of the debate. Later on, Biden somewhat picked up the pace to push back against Trumpâs slew of factually incorrect assertions about immigration and abortion. However, Democrats raised the alarm over Bidenâs performance, with some even starting to talk about replacing him on the presidential ticket. âThere are going to be discussions about whether he [Biden] should continue,â David Axelrod, former senior adviser to former President Barack Obama, told CNN. While Bidenâs Vice President Kamala Harris backed him after the debate, saying substance matters over style in this election, even she conceded âit was a slow startâ. nan nan Biden and Trump went back and forth over which of them is physically and cognitively stronger. Trump boasted about his strength, claiming, âIâm in as good shape as I was 25, 30 years ago,â to moderators Jake Tapper and Dana Bash. In response, a snickering Biden implied his opponent was lying about both his height and weight. Trump said he had won two championships on his golf course while Biden âcanât hit the ball 50 yardsâ. This prompted Biden to challenge Trump to a golf match, only if Trump would carry his own bag. âLetâs not act like children,â said Trump. âYou are a child,â responded Biden. nan nan âWe are the biggest producer of support for Israel of anyone in the world,â Biden said, reiterating US support for Israelâs war on Gaza in which more than 37,718 Palestinians have been killed since October last year. Biden added that his administration is continuing to send experts and intelligence to hinder Palestinian group Hamas in the war. Trump snapped back, saying it is Israel that wants to continue with the war, âand you should let them go, and let them finish the job. He [Biden] doesnât want to do it. Heâs become like a Palestinian, but they donât like him because heâs a very bad Palestinian, heâs a weak oneâ. In the nearly nine months of the war that has left Gaza rife with power outages and food insecurity, the United States has provided military and diplomatic assistance to Israel, and has repeatedly blocked ceasefire resolutions. A US-sponsored resolution endorsing a ceasefire proposal eventually only passed at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) some eight months into the war. nan nan Trump invoked anti-abortion sentiment by accusing Biden and his party of allowing late-term abortions. During the debate, Trump claimed Biden and Democrats would be âwilling to, as we say, rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth monthâ. âYouâre lying. That is simply not true,â Biden refuted Trumpâs assertion. âWe are not for late-term abortion, period. Period.â Trump also said of Democrats: âThey will take the life of a child â¦ even after birthâ, despite the fact that infanticide is illegal in every US state. In the US, late-term abortions are uncommon and are usually a last resort when there are serious complications with a wanted pregnancy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, fewer than 1 percent of abortions were performed at or after 21 weeks in 2020. Throughout the debate, Trump turned the topic to immigration, accusing Biden of âopening up the safest border in the world to terrorists, prisonersâ. He accused Biden of being âthe one that killed people with a bad border and flooding hundreds of thousands of people dying and also killing our citizens when they come inâ. Biden on the other hand recounted the work his administration has done to manage an influx of illegal immigrants, including tightening border security and working on the bipartisan National SecurityÂ Agreement. âBy the way, the border patrol have endorsed me, endorsed my position,â a wide-eyed Biden said. âWhen he [Trump] was president, he was separating babies from their mothers, putting them in cages, making sure their families were separated. Thatâs not the right way to goâ. Trump snapped back, saying, âthe border patrol, I wonât say that, but they endorsed me for presidentâ. nan nan Trump did not directly answer whether he would honour the result of the election. He said he would only accept the results if the election is âfree and fairâ, reiterating false claims that the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden, was rigged against him. âThe fraud and everything else was ridiculous,â he said. Following the 2020 election result, Trump incited his supporters to storm the US Capitol in the infamous January 6, 2021 Capitol riots. During the debate, Trump downplayed the riots, which were the deadliest attack on US power in more than 200 years. âThey talk about a relatively small number of people that went to the Capitol and in many cases were ushered in by the police,â he said. The next presidential debate is slated for September 10 and will be hosted by ABC news."
Six-legged 'mermaid' dog finds new home by the sea,"A dog born with six legs and dumped in a car park has finally found her forever home. Ariel made headlines around the world when, aged 11 weeks, she was discovered outside a Pembrokeshire supermarket last October. About £15,000 was then raised by well-wishers for a life-changing operation to remove her extra back limbs, which partially fused together to resemble a mermaid's tail. Now the spaniel - named after Disney's The Little Mermaid - has finally been adopted, aptly starting a new life by the sea with a couple who teach people with disabilities how to surf. She had been initially looked after by Greenacres Rescue near Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, which was then deluged with calls from hundreds of people who had read about her plight and wanted to adopt her. At about the same time Emma-Mary Webster and Ollie Bird were recovering from losing their own dog of 16 years, a labrador/German shorthaired pointer cross called Pippin. ""Pippin was a lovely boy who was swimming in the sea and climbing rocks right up until the day before he died suddenly,"" said Ollie, 40, who runs the Pembrokeshire-based Blue Horizons Surf Club alongside his partner. ""We were so heartbroken we felt like we'd never get another dog, but the hole he left in our lives was so huge we realised we had to try to fill it somehow. ""So we applied to Greenacres to see if they had any dogs up for adoption, not long after which a volunteer rang saying she thought she had the perfect candidate for us."" At that point he and Emma-Mary, 50, had no idea who Ariel was. ""She was brought to ours for a home visit and took to the place straight away, really made herself comfortable,"" he said. ""Neither of us were at all aware we had a celebrity in our midst."" ""Even now, whenever we take her for a walk along the coast someone will come over and ask for a selfie with her. ""And Ariel adores the attention, not to mention beach life and splashing around in the water."" She has also become a big part of the daily goings-on at the surf club. ""Me and Emma-Mary got the idea for Blue Horizons after Covid because lots of our friends had gone through a very hard time,"" he said. ""We really wanted to help with their sense of well-being, after which we decided to make things as inclusive as possible."" The club now specialises in adaptive surf lessons and boat trips for people of all ages with a range of physical and mental disabilities, including cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and dementia. ""Ariel loves being part of those lessons too,"" said Ollie. ""She's always a big hit with whoever we take out onto the waves and she never stops wanting to play."" He added that despite her difficult start in life - having also been born with an extra vulva and only one kidney - Ariel has virtually made a full recovery. ""You should see how excited she gets whenever we get out her leash, not to mention the way she runs around on the sand,"" he said. ""Other than a tiny bit of nerve damage in one of her back legs you'd never think she'd ever had anything wrong with her."""
Sixth-form college celebrates 'outstanding' rating,"The college was rated as outstanding in all the categories assessed, including the quality of education, behaviour and attitudes, personal development, leadership and management, education programmes for young people, adult learning programmes and provision for learners with high needs. Inspectors praised the ""very high standard"" of work produced by students and added that they ""demonstrate very positive attitudes to their learning, attend well and are prompt to lessons"". The report added: ""Teachers use a range of effective teaching techniques to ensure that students have time to consolidate learning and transfer key concepts to their long-term memory."" It also said that managers talked to local firms to ensure the college provided training in ""the skills that employers need"". The college was told in 2016 that it needed to improve, but it received a ""good"" rating in its last inspection in 2018. Interim principal Wendy Ellis said: ""I am immensely proud of our college community for achieving an Ofsted 'outstanding' grade. ""This is testament to our collective hard work, dedication and commitment to providing an exceptional educational experience for all our students.""

"Slavery, migration and jihadists - the issues as Mauritania votes","When former President Mohamed ould Abdel Aziz stepped down in 2019 after his tenure, it heralded a new era for a country that had endured multiple military coups and authoritarian rule. ""Mauritania has the strongest democratic credentials in the Sahel at present, which given its history of coups is quite surprising, Joseph Hammond, iDove Fellow at the African Union, told the BBC. One of those hoping to be Mauritania's next leader is Biram ould Dah ould Abeid, who came second in the 2019 elections. Mr Abeid's grandparents were slaves and he has spent much of his life campaigning against the practice. He has been arrested and imprisoned over the years because of his work as president of the Initiative for the Resurgence of the Abolitionist Movement (IRA). Slavery remains a sensitive issue in Mauritania, which was the last country in the world to outlaw slavery, in 1981. ""My father fought against pro-slavery all his life. I swore to my father that I would fight without ever compromising. I would fight slavery and those who support it,"" Mr Abeid told the BBC in 2016. It has been abolished in the country three times, but thousands of black Mauritanians still live as unpaid domestic servants, while anti-slavery activists face repression. An estimated 149,000 people are enslaved in Mauritania - about 3% of the population, according to the Global Slavery Index (GSI) in 2023. Migration is another hot topic issue that will be on voters' minds as they head to the polls. Mauritania is a key transit point for migrants trying to reach Europe from West Africa, with thousands of boats departing from the country last year. In April, the European Union granted Mauritania 210m (£177m; $225m) in aid - almost 60m of which will be invested in the fight against illegal immigration to Europe. Corruption also continues to be a major problem in Mauritania. Former President Aziz was jailed for five years for illicit enrichment and embezzlement and is disqualified from standing in the election. The country is rich in various natural resources like iron, gold, phosphate and is an upcoming market in the oil sector in Africa, yet almost 59% of the population lives in poverty, according to the United Nations. It also has huge potential in renewable energy - particularly green hydrogen. This form of energy could eventually provide a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels and play a role in the countrys carbon-free energy transition. Investors from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, particularly the United Arab Emirates, aim to make Mauritania an energy hub for green hydrogen production, according to the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. President Ghazouani has also campaigned on the importance of the country's security. Mauritania is in the Sahel region, the semi-arid strip of land south of the Sahara desert, which is a hotbed of jihadist activity, but the country has been generally free of  attacks since 2011. Its neighbour, Mali, however continues to struggle with repeated jihadist attacks. Analysts have partially credited President Ghazouani, whose long career in the army and security services has given him a deep understanding of the jihadist challenges facing the Sahel region. President Ghazouani has developed a close alliance with Western partners like France and the US, but has also been careful to keep ties with its military-run neighbours like Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, who have shunned Western influence recently, reports the AFP news agency. Head of the US Africa Command, Gen Michael Langley, said Mauritania has had a longstanding role in countering terrorism and preventing violent extremism in the Sahel. Cheikhani Khlil, communication professor at Mauritania's Lebanese International University, told the BBC President Ghazouani has allied Mauritania with the US to combat the attacks. ""There is continued training conducted by US special forces for Mauritanian special forces units to secure national borders, which reinforces the tactical capabilities and combat readiness of our armed forces,"" he said. Analysts say that as an important player in regional security, Mauritanias ability to continue this leadership role depends to a significant extent on an effective and peaceful transfer of power that leads to a stable government.

President Mohamed ould Cheikh Ghazouani, who has been in power since the country's first democratic transition in 2019, is seeking a second and final term. Six other candidates are challenging him for the top job. This election is a litmus test of Mauritanias burgeoning democracy and an indicator of how well it is progressing on its path to greater political openness.

An estimated 149,000 people are enslaved in Mauritania - about 3% of the population, according to the Global Slavery Index (GSI) in 2023. Migration is another hot topic issue that will be on voters' minds as they head to the polls. Mauritania is a key transit point for migrants trying to reach Europe from West Africa, with thousands of boats departing from the country last year. In April, the European Union granted Mauritania 210m (£177m; $225m) in aid - almost 60m of which will be invested in the fight against illegal immigration to Europe. Corruption also continues to be a major problem in Mauritania. Former President Aziz was jailed for five years for illicit enrichment and embezzlement and is disqualified from standing in the election. The country is rich in various natural resources like iron, gold, phosphate and is an upcoming market in the oil sector in Africa, yet almost 59% of the population lives in poverty, according to the United Nations. It also has huge potential in renewable energy - particularly green hydrogen. This form of energy could eventually provide a cleaner alternative to fossil fuels and play a role in the countrys carbon-free energy transition. Investors from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, particularly the United Arab Emirates, aim to make Mauritania an energy hub for green hydrogen production, according to the Africa Center for Strategic Studies. President Ghazouani has also campaigned on the importance of the country's security. Mauritania is in the Sahel region, the semi-arid strip of land south of the Sahara desert, which is a hotbed of jihadist activity, but the country has been generally free of  attacks since 2011. Its neighbour, Mali, however continues to struggle with repeated jihadist attacks. Analysts have partially credited President Ghazouani, whose long career in the army and security services has given him a deep understanding of the jihadist challenges facing the Sahel region. President Ghazouani has developed a close alliance with Western partners like France and the US, but has also been careful to keep ties with its military-run neighbours like Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, who have shunned Western influence recently, reports the AFP news agency. Head of the US Africa Command, Gen Michael Langley, said Mauritania has had a longstanding role in countering terrorism and preventing violent extremism in the Sahel. Cheikhani Khlil, communication professor at Mauritania's Lebanese International University, told the BBC President Ghazouani has allied Mauritania with the US to combat the attacks. ""There is continued training conducted by US special forces for Mauritanian special forces units to secure national borders, which reinforces the tactical capabilities and combat readiness of our armed forces,"" he said. Analysts say that as an important player in regional security, Mauritanias ability to continue this leadership role depends to a significant extent on an effective and peaceful transfer of power that leads to a stable government.

Slow-moving driver guilty after motorcyclist death,"A previous jury had been unable to reach a verdict in October 2022 and the conviction on Wednesday was part of a retrial. Max Grkinic who ran to the scene to help told the jury he heard Ms Wilson say: ""Oh my God I have killed him."" Mr Richardson was lying on the carriageway of the A414 and Ms Wilsons white Fiat 500car was on fire. Mr Grkinic's wife Cara had seen Wilson's Fiat move slowly from the hard shoulder with its hazard lights on. It continued to move slowly in lane one of the dual carriageway. Asked to estimate the speed of the Fiat, she said: ""Five or 10mph. It was very confusing. I wasnt really sure why."" A collision expert said Ms Wilson was driving at about 19mph (30km/h) but she said she was driving at 30mph (48km/h). Mr Richardson, who had been riding within the speed limit, at between 60 and 70mph, was pronounced dead at the scene. During a police interview, Wilson said she had stopped because she was worried about having a mechanical problem. She said she had checked her mirrors twice before pulling out into lane one and told the police there was nothing behind her. Giving evidence, Wilson said: ""The accident happened quite quickly. ""All I know is that the bike was travelling faster than me. ""I dont know why the bike did not see me that day and use the right lane. It was completely free."" She added: ""I am a careful driver. I have never even had a knock or a clip."" Follow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story? Email eastofenglandnews@bbc.co.uk or WhatsApp us on 0800 169 1830"
Solar panel scheme gets further roll-out,"Through savings delivered to the council via group-buying, parties expressing an interest would be given a quote for the cost of installation, and could then decide if they wished to proceed or not, the council said. The scheme offered a 10-year warranty, added the authority, which also stated that installers would only be appointed having gone through a rigorous vetting process.

Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk A scheme designed to boost the uptake of solar panel technology among Worcestershire residents is getting another roll-out. Worcestershire County Council said a similar programme last year had been successful in moving people to renewable forms of energy, adding the scheme offered installation at competitive prices. More than 500 residents installed solar panels under the earlier project, according to the authority, which estimated the move saved more than 9,000 tonnes of carbon over the panels expected 25-year lifespan. Residents and businesses have until 9 August to register their interest in the project's forthcoming round.

Soup sales up and sun cream down in wet June,"nan Despite the improving shopper sentiment, the washout spring dampened spending  particularly for products associated with warm weather. Sales of sun care items slumped by a quarter and prepared salad sales fell by more than a tenth, Kantar said. Warm fresh soup sales jumped by almost a quarter, but this wasnt enough to increase grocery sales overall. The Office for National Statistics recently said that wet weather had dampened consumer spending and activity in the construction industry in April. Climate change means that extreme weather conditions are more likely, though scientists say it is difficult to pin any particular weather pattern on the warming climate. Meanwhile, Kantar predicts a spending jump because of the Euros football tournament  and not just at pubs and restaurants, but with a 40% leap in beer and cider promotions at shops in the last four weeks. Retailers will be competing with fans heading out of the house to watch the football as well as with each other, said Mr McKevitt. nan The Kantar data also revealed which supermarket chains are succeeding in the competition to attract more shoppers. It said Ocado was the fastest growing grocer for the fourth month in a row, with sales up over a tenth. Lidl was the second-fastest. Tesco, the largest supermarket chain in the UK, further boosted its market share over the same period. The wins came at the expense of Asda, the Co-Op, smaller chains and independent supermarkets, whose market share fell."

Southampton stadium fan zone plans approved,"Plans for new fan zones and big screens outside Southamptons St Marys Stadium have been given the green light by the city council. The Premier League clubs proposals feature a stage with large screens, food and drink stalls and a playing area on land around the ground. Representatives for the club said the scheme aimed to improve the experience for fans on match days and could be used to broadcast other sporting events this summer, such as the Paris Olympics. The changes will result in the loss of about half of the stadium's parking spaces, including disabled ones. Outside the Northam Stand there will be a large marquee, stage and large screens. Behind the Chapel Stand, a 4G playing area will be installed as well as another stage. Finally, there will be food and drink stalls outside the Kingsland Stand, which will be the new home of away fans. In total, there will be 15 food and drink stalls dotted around the stadium exterior. Planning officers from Southampton City Council approved the proposals - which were submitted in April - under delegated powers. A report by the case officer said: The proposed use would enhance the offer at the football club which is a valuable asset to the city centre. The use itself is complementary to the club and subject to securing the appropriate mitigation, will not harm residential amenity. Work has already started on the scheme. On-site car parking at the stadium will be reduced from 237 standard spaces and 57 disabled spaces to 106 and 30, respectively. The application did include plans to reduce the number of cycle storage spaces from 157 to 66, but the council insisted on revisions to the plans to increase that number.

Special PC posed as woman to exchange sexual images,"Mr Daisley, who stepped down in December 2023, had been arrested in August 2022 by another force on an unrelated matter, and had his devices seized. That revealed he had set up the fake Facebook profile using a picture of an unknown woman under the fictional name of Chloe Taylor.

Starmer backs sanctions for 'stolen valour' offence,"Asked if there should be further sanctions against Mr Adderley, he said: ""Stolen valour is really serious.

Starmer: Claim Labour is danger to security 'ridiculous',"Speaking on a campaign visit in Aldershot in Hampshire, known as the home of the British Army, on Armed Forces Day, Sir Keir was asked about the Tory claim Labour would put the country's national security at risk. ""I think this is desperate stuff from the Tories,"" he said, highlighting that the UK joined the Nato military alliance under a Labour government and the party's support had been ""unshakeable since then"". He also pointed to Labour's support for the UK's nuclear deterrent, as well as the construction of four new nuclear submarines and any future upgrades needed. ""We have also - and this is why it is really desperate from the Tories - united with this government, the Tory government, on really important issues of national security,"" he said. ""As a result of that, they have given me high-level sensitive briefings, so much do they trust us on national security."" He added: ""To now turn around and make this ridiculous claim just shows how desperate they have become going into this election."" Later on Saturday, Sir Keir addressed a Labour event in London, where he told party supporters the Conservatives could win the election next week if ""we take our foot off the gas, if people think it's in the bag"". He said the party would need a ""clear mandate"" to deliver its plans if it forms the next government. ""Each and every vote is out there ready to be earned,"" he said. Earlier in the day, Mr Mercer said Sir Keir had not matched Tory pledges for veterans or to increase defence spending. He added: ""Only the Conservatives have a clear plan to support our armed forces and secure the future of our country. Don't vote to let Starmer put us all in danger from Downing Street."" Meanwhile, security minister Tom Tugendhat told BBC Breakfast the UK would be ""more vulnerable to foreign pressure"" under a Labour government. He pointed out that Sir Keir's shadow cabinet included some people who had previously opposed the country's nuclear deterrent, Trident. The Tories have promised to increase UK defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2030, while Labour has committed to the target when economic conditions allow. Keeping an Office for Veterans' Affairs and ensuring veterans get the benefits and compensations they deserve are also among the Conservative Party's election pledges. Labour has pledged to introduce a new armed force commissioner, who would have the ability to investigate issues affecting the lives of military personnel like sub-standard housing. The party has been keen to stress its support for the armed forces and the UK's nuclear deterrent, after the issue was used to attack the its previous leader, Jeremy Corbyn, in the 2019 general election. Labour has sought to highlight that 14 former military personnel are among its election candidates, which it says is the largest number in modern history. The Liberal Democrats also have an ambition to reach at least 2.5% of national income on defence, while the party has pledged to reverse cuts to troop numbers and improve military housing. The Scottish National Party's manifesto includes a promise to scrap Trident and invest the money saved in public services and conventional defence.

He added: ""To now turn around and make this ridiculous claim just shows how desperate they have become going into this election."" Later on Saturday, Sir Keir addressed a Labour event in London, where he told party supporters the Conservatives could win the election next week if ""we take our foot off the gas, if people think it's in the bag"". He said the party would need a ""clear mandate"" to deliver its plans if it forms the next government. ""Each and every vote is out there ready to be earned,"" he said. Earlier in the day, Mr Mercer said Sir Keir had not matched Tory pledges for veterans or to increase defence spending. He added: ""Only the Conservatives have a clear plan to support our armed forces and secure the future of our country. Don't vote to let Starmer put us all in danger from Downing Street."" Meanwhile, security minister Tom Tugendhat told BBC Breakfast the UK would be ""more vulnerable to foreign pressure"" under a Labour government. He pointed out that Sir Keir's shadow cabinet included some people who had previously opposed the country's nuclear deterrent, Trident. The Tories have promised to increase UK defence spending to 2.5% of national income by 2030, while Labour has committed to the target when economic conditions allow. Keeping an Office for Veterans' Affairs and ensuring veterans get the benefits and compensations they deserve are also among the Conservative Party's election pledges. Labour has pledged to introduce a new armed force commissioner, who would have the ability to investigate issues affecting the lives of military personnel like sub-standard housing. The party has been keen to stress its support for the armed forces and the UK's nuclear deterrent, after the issue was used to attack the its previous leader, Jeremy Corbyn, in the 2019 general election. Labour has sought to highlight that 14 former military personnel are among its election candidates, which it says is the largest number in modern history. The Liberal Democrats also have an ambition to reach at least 2.5% of national income on defence, while the party has pledged to reverse cuts to troop numbers and improve military housing. The Scottish National Party's manifesto includes a promise to scrap Trident and invest the money saved in public services and conventional defence. Sir Keir Starmer has branded Conservative suggestions that a Labour government would be a threat to national security as ""ridiculous"". The Labour leader said the claim was ""desperate"" as he had been trusted with sensitive defence briefings by the government. It comes after veterans minister Johnny Mercer said only the Tories had a plan to support the armed forces and a vote for Labour would ""put us all in danger"". Parties are focusing their campaigning on defence in the last weekend before 4 July polling day. Speaking on a campaign visit in Aldershot in Hampshire, known as the home of the British Army, on Armed Forces Day, Sir Keir was asked about the Tory claim Labour would put the country's national security at risk. ""I think this is desperate stuff from the Tories,"" he said, highlighting that the UK joined the Nato military alliance under a Labour government and the party's support had been ""unshakeable since then"". He also pointed to Labour's support for the UK's nuclear deterrent, as well as the construction of four new nuclear submarines and any future upgrades needed. ""We have also - and this is why it is really desperate from the Tories - united with this government, the Tory government, on really important issues of national security,"" he said.

Stories of war dead shared from beyond the grave,"Flt Lt Vincent Bushy Parker grew up in Australia after emigrating there when he was a child. From a young age, he was said to be quite the illusionist, mastering any card trick or wizardry he could find. En route back to England as a steward on a passenger liner, he decided to follow the path of his older brother and become a fighter pilot. He was known to have flown in the Battle of Britain and was credited with shooting down five German aircraft. However, on 15 August, 1940, his Spitfire was shot down near the Isle of Wight and he was captured by the Germans as a prisoner of war. Eventually taken to Colditz and determined to escape life under German rule, he used his knowledge of trickery to try and fool his captors. From tunnelling to lock-picking, to impersonating German soldiers, his quest for freedom was relentless. After nearly four years in captivity, he and his comrades were released following liberation by the Americans in 1945. He returned to England to serve with the RAF. However, less than a year later, the 27-year-old's aircraft crashed while on exercise and he was killed instantly. In 1940, Britain established its Commonwealth Air Training Plan, an agreement between the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, to train 50,000 air crew a year for as long as needed. Many of the trainees also came from other countries, including 19-year-old Urlic Leslie Look Yan. Having spent four months of initial training in his home country of Trinidad, he came from the Port of Spain to spend several months in Canada, where he trained as a pilot. In 1943 he was posted to England to continue his training, moving eventually to RAF Milfield, near Northumberland, where he learned to fly the RAF's Hurricane fighter planes. On 14 January, 1944, the flying officer flew into cloud at high speed while engaged in a low-level, cross-country flight, crashing his plane near the town of Wooler. The RAF said the 21-year-old was one of 250 volunteers from Trinidad who flew in combat with the RAF during the war, with 50 dying in action. Laid to rest in the Harrogate cemetery, Sgt Isikeli Doviverata Komaisava was buried a long way from home after his death in 1944. He was descended from the King of Fiji, Cakobaua, and the son of a high chief in the South Pacific island, which was a British colony in the 1940s. Back then, it was common for the children of high chiefs to study in New Zealand, which is where he spent three years before returning to Fiji with plans to become a surveyor. However, having read that Britain needed every able-bodied man to join the war effort, he asked his father's permission to volunteer. Aged 21, he was accepted into the RAF and after training in Canada, served as a pilot with 234 Squadron, based in the south of England. He died in Aylesbury Hospital in 1944 aged 24 from lung disease and is understood to be the only Fijian who served with the RAF during World War Two. Although many of those who lost their lives during the war are buried far from their homeland, Flt Sgt Basil Furnace Snell rests in his home town of Harrogate Born in 1914, he graduated from his scholarship at Christ Church Grammar School to become a clerk at an accountancy firm. He joined the RAF in 1940 and during the war made 16 operational flights. One of those flights earned him the award of the Distinguished Flying Medal for his courage and determination in September 1942. He was captain of a Whitley bomber aircraft flying near the Isle of Lewis when he detected a surfaced German submarine almost seven miles away. He flew through low cloud and over rough seas, emerging at 20ft to attack, killing 43 people on board. News of his achievements made the newspaper headlines in Yorkshire. But in May 1943, aged 28, he was killed alongside two trainee pilots in a flying accident over Lincolnshire. ""A sad death in a beautiful place"" is how the family of 21-year-old Flt Sgt Donald Hopkins described the crash site that claimed his life. Born in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in March 1923, he worked as an accountant in Gateshead before volunteering and becoming a navigator with the RAF in 1941. On the night of 22 April, 1944, Sgt Hopkins, along with six other members of his crew, were sent on a mission to bomb Dusseldorf - a city which was a focal point of British air raids. The major attack featured 323 Lancaster bombers, 254 Halifaxes and 19 Mosquito aircraft, dropping in total 2,150 tonnes of bombs. The raid was penetrated by German night fighters and it is thought that Sgt Hopkins's Lancaster suffered damage, affecting its journey back home. While his aircraft was able to return to British shores, bad visibility affected the flight which caused the crew to fly too low and ultimately crash over the Yorkshire Wolds near Bridlington.

Strike may force Tata steel closures next week,"Last week the Unite union announced that about 1,500 workers would begin an indefinite strike on 8 July over the company's plans to cut thousands of jobs. Onay Kasab, the national lead for Unite, told Radio Wales Breakfast that the union was due to have a conversation with the company regarding safety during the strike. Mr Kasab denied if the union had given the company an opportunity to shut the site. ""What other option have we got when we are facing 2,800 job losses. We have said to Tata, again and again, 'wait for a general election, wait for a new Labour government'"" he said. Mr Kasab said the union have a letter from the company asking the union to wait until after the general election for discussions to take place. However, the company previously said it would not be changing course in Port Talbot, regardless of who wins the general election. About 2,800 Tata Steel workers will lose their jobs when the company closes both blast furnaces in Port Talbot by the end of September. At the time, the company said if the strike affected the safety or stability of its operations it would be ""forced"" to accelerate closure plans. A spokesperson for Tata said: ""Following the announcement by Unite union to unilaterally call strike action from 8 July, Tata Steel is unfortunately forced to  commence legal action to challenge the validity of Unite's ballot. ""In the coming days, if we cannot be certain that we are able to continue to safely and stably operate our assets through the period of strike action, we will not have any choice but to pause or stop heavy end operations [including both blast furnaces] on the Port Talbot site. ""That is not a decision we would take lightly, and we recognise that it would prove extremely costly and disruptive throughout the supply chain, but the safety of people on or around our sites will always take priority over everything else."" Tata said it is again calling on Unite to withdraw its industrial action and join Community and GMB unions in ""giving consideration"" to the company's proposal, which Tata said includes ""generous employee support packages, training and skills development"". It said it ""understands"" the impact the restructuring will have on many employees and contractors, but that it ""remains committed to a just transition"" and hopes for a ""long and sustainable future"" in the UK. The company plans to build a £1.25bn electric arc furnace to produce steel in a way which is less polluting than traditional blast furnaces but requires fewer workers. Tata said the move would secure the future of steelmaking at the site and the UK government is contributing £500m towards the cost of the project. The plans for the site will see both furnaces shut down. Number five will go off by the end of next week as planned while four is due to go off by the end of September. Preparatory work to shut down five will begin by 1 July if the strike goes ahead. Other elements that will close include the harbour, sinter plant, ore yards and primary steelmaking. Sharon Graham, the Unite general secretary, said the union is ""fighting for the future of the steel industry"". She said Unite has secured ""serious investment"" from Labour to safeguard jobs. ""Tata putting out a statement to shut or pause its blast furnaces three months earlier than they intended to is the latest in a long line of threats that won't deter us. ""The Unite campaign is not about selling jobs, it's about securing the long-term future of steel making in this country for thousands of workers in Port Talbot and South Wales."" Unite said it is calling on the ""real decision makers"" in Mumbai to realise that ""the investment secured will be good for the company and workers."" GMB union said Tata must ""step back"" from this ""irreversible decision"" and instead ""safeguard steelmaking assets"". GMB national officer, Charlotte Brumpton-Childs, said that the upcoming general election could ""change so much"", and that GMB's next actions would be decided by its members. The Community union condemned Tata's ""unacceptable"" decision to bring forward the closure and said it continued to support the Labour Party's call for Tata not to make irreversible decisions before the general election. Developments have escalated quickly in the past two weeks. Unite is one of three unions which represents steelworkers and it has so far been the most militant in its action in the face of significant job cuts across Tatas UK operations. Members are currently working to rule and theres a ban on any overtime. However, the decision to walk out indefinitely is an escalation which now potentially threatens the early closure of the UKs largest steelmaking operation in Port Talbot. Tata says it would have no option but to close if the strike goes ahead, but in the meantime the company has filed for an injunction at the High Court to try to prevent the strike happening. It suggests Unites ballot on industrial action wasnt carried out properly. With the action due on 8 July, Tata will need a ruling quickly. The other unions, Community and GMB, say theyll wait until after the general election before deciding whether to strike too. But having spoken to a number of steelworkers in Port Talbot, the sense is that many dont want a strike which could cost them the current offer on the table from the company. What happens during the course of the next week could be crucial to the future of thousands of livelihoods, although Tata says no redundancies will be made until the end of September, regardless. First Minister Vaughan Gething described the news from Tata as ""extraordinary"" and urged the company to wait for the result of next week's general election. In a statement, Mr Gething said: ""The news that Tata could switch off blast furnaces four and five at Port Talbot next week is extraordinary and will cause huge anxiety for the workforce, their families and the community. ""The Welsh government cannot and will not support the closure of both blast furnaces"". He added that acting whilst the nation went to the polls did not help de-escalate matters. Samuel Kurtz, the Welsh Conservative shadow minister for economy and energy,said it was ""disappointing news that will cause additional distress to communities already dealing with enough as it is"". ""Tata have shown no goodwill to their workforce at what is an anxious time. The Welsh Labour government have also only paid lip service to Tata's workforce, failing to contribute a penny to the transition board, and UK Labour's manifesto says nothing on what it would do differently to support Port Talbot's steelworkers,"" he added. Luke Fletcher, Plaid Cymru's economy spokesperson, said steel should be brought under the control of the next UK government, which Plaid believes will be led by Sir Keir Starmer. Mr Fletcher said: ""The time has come now for an incoming Labour government to put words into action on steel. ""Save our steel is no good as just a slogan, if we are going to save our steel, nationalisation needs to happen on day one.""

Stroke survivor develops French accent,"A 21-year-old Jersey athlete says he is determined to make a full recovery after a stroke left him speaking with a French accent. Jack Allan was sparring in mixed martial arts at university in the UK when a kick to the jaw caused a bleed on his brain. It was two weeks before he was able to talk and when he did, he had a French accent. On his return to Jersey, Mr Allan's speech therapist diagnosed him with Foreign Accent Syndrome. Foreign accent syndrome (FAS) is a condition that alters a person's speech patterns to make it sound like they are speaking in another language. This usually happens as a result of brain damage, such as from a stroke, doctors say. Johan Verhoeven, a professor of experimental phonetics at City, University of London said there have been about 200 cases of FAS reported in clinical studies to date, making it ""quite a rare speech disorder"". Describing his recovery process, Mr Allan said: ""On top of learning how to talk again, I had to change my accent back to the normal accent I had before. ""When I'm tired or angry, it kind of slips out, or if I talk too fast. So I'm working on trying to get to talk fast but with my English or Jersey accent. ""I thought it was funny. My mates thought it was funny. ""I didn't think much about it. I just thought on to recovery, to trying to get back to normal. That was my mindset,"" he added. Mr Allan has been told there is no increased risk of another stroke and he believes the discipline of sports training has given him the mental and physical strength he needs to recover. ""I swim, I go to the gym, I'm out kicking the ball in the garden,"" he said. ""Sport, being physically active, competing, is part of who I am and that won't change. ""It's just it will take a while to get back to where I was,"" he added. Follow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook. Send your story ideas to channel.islands@bbc.co.uk."

Students banned from camping in LSE atrium,"The London School of Economics (LSE) has been granted a court order indefinitely barring camps in one of its buildings after students slept in an atrium for more than a month in support of Palestine. Several students pitched up on the ground floor of the Marshall Building in central London on 14 May. They vowed to remain there until LSE met a series of demands. LSE began legal action this month, with a judge granting it an interim possession order on 14 June. That meant the activists had to leave within 24 hours of the order being served. The students left on 17 June, minutes before the deadline. At a hearing at Central London County Court on Friday, District Judge Morayo Fagborun-Bennett granted a possession order, meaning no encampments can be set up at the same location indefinitely. Olivia Davies, for LSE, said: ""The defendants don't dispute the claimant's entitlement."" She continued: ""They were served with an interim possession order and they vacated in accordance with it. There have been no breaches of the interim order."" Daniel Grutters, representing three students, said: ""Those instructing me had only opposed the making of the interim possession order. ""Since that was made, we indicated that we would not defend the possession order."" The camp was set up after the release of the Assets in Apartheid report by the LSE Students' Union's Palestine Society.

Students' Nazi song video branded reprehensible,"The song in question, titled Erika, was composed in about 1930 and became popular as a marching song for German soldiers in the WW2 Nazi era. As dinner attendees dance while the music plays, shouts of ""sehr gut"" - German for ""very good"" - can be heard. Leaders from The Union of Jewish Students described the gatherings blatant and unchallenged support for Nazism as utterly abhorrent. Glorification of the Nazis has no place in our society, they said, adding it is in no way acceptable and must be widely condemned. They called for a swift and decisive response, saying: Actions must have consequences. UWCA told the BBC the song was requested by a lone member and was not part of the pre-planned music selection for the event. They said the individual who requested it, and another person who was not a member of the group, would be barred from future events. They said most attendees were unaware of the origins or connotations of the song. In a statement, UWCA said it rejected any allegation its group normalised racism. Our members have consistently campaigned against anti-Semitism on campus,"" it said. Our members have also worked hard to ensure the Students Union commemorates Holocaust Memorial Day in a fitting way. We are proud of these efforts and will continue to stand against discrimination. UWCA added it was committed to ensuring anyone else found to have knowingly engaged with the song was no longer welcome at events. Once again, we apologise for the hurt this incident has caused and will fully cooperate with any subsequent investigation initiated by the university, the statement read. A spokesperson for the university said the material was being reviewed.

Describing the footage as extremely troubling, the university said it was alerted to the content by its reporting service, adding it had notified the Students Union and requested a meeting with the Jewish Society to assist a review. According to a story in The Sunday Times, the leaked video, shared on social media, shows events at a University of Warwick Conservative Association (UWCA) dinner, held off campus in May. The group has condemned the scenes and apologised. The song in question, titled Erika, was composed in about 1930 and became popular as a marching song for German soldiers in the WW2 Nazi era. As dinner attendees dance while the music plays, shouts of ""sehr gut"" - German for ""very good"" - can be heard. Leaders from The Union of Jewish Students described the gatherings blatant and unchallenged support for Nazism as utterly abhorrent. Glorification of the Nazis has no place in our society, they said, adding it is in no way acceptable and must be widely condemned. They called for a swift and decisive response, saying: Actions must have consequences. UWCA told the BBC the song was requested by a lone member and was not part of the pre-planned music selection for the event. They said the individual who requested it, and another person who was not a member of the group, would be barred from future events. They said most attendees were unaware of the origins or connotations of the song. In a statement, UWCA said it rejected any allegation its group normalised racism. Our members have consistently campaigned against anti-Semitism on campus,"" it said. Our members have also worked hard to ensure the Students Union commemorates Holocaust Memorial Day in a fitting way. We are proud of these efforts and will continue to stand against discrimination. UWCA added it was committed to ensuring anyone else found to have knowingly engaged with the song was no longer welcome at events. Once again, we apologise for the hurt this incident has caused and will fully cooperate with any subsequent investigation initiated by the university, the statement read. A spokesperson for the university said the material was being reviewed.

Supreme Court rejects claim White House limited free speech on social media,"The Supreme Court has rejected a case claiming the Biden administration illegally coerced social media platforms into taking down posts about Covid-19 and the 2020 election that were considered misinformation. Five social media users, along with the attorneys general from Louisiana and Missouri, had brought the case, saying the Biden administration's pressure on companies like Facebook and X, formerly Twitter, violated the constitutional right to free speech. In Wednesday's 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court said the plaintiffs did not have the legal standing to sue. The three most conservative justices opposed the decision, with Justice Samuel Alito publishing a blistering dissent that spanned 34 pages, where he wrote that this may be ""one of the most important free speech cases to reach this court in years"". Even though the ruling was on a technical issue and not the heart of the case, it was a win for President Joe Biden. It overturned an injunction limiting communications between social media companies and government officials.  That means the FBI and other agencies can now flag to platforms posts and accounts that they believe threaten national security. The plaintiffs had argued federal officials pressured - or ""jawboned"" - the companies into suppressing speech that the government did not agree with, mainly about the coronavirus pandemic. They pointed to the platforms pushing down posts or suspending accounts after communicating with the White House. The Biden administration countered it was persuading social media platforms to limit problematic content that included lies and misleading claims, which the surgeon general had warned would put lives at risks. It added that many of the flagged posts also went against the companies' internal policies. ""The plaintiffs fail, by and large, to link their past social-media restrictions and the defendants communications with the platforms,"" Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote for the majority. She was joined by the three liberal members of the court along with Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh. In a dissent that detailed emails, press conferences, and past decisions, Justice Alito  painted the ""jawboning"" as  ""blatantly unconstitutional"". Wednesday's ruling, he wrote, ""permits the successful campaign of coercion in this case to stand as an attractive model for future officials who want to control what the people say, hear, and think"". By rejecting the case, too, the court was helping send a message: ""If a coercive campaign is carried out with enough sophistication, it may get by."" Before Wednesday's decision, a federal district judge in Louisiana had sided with social media users and agreed White House officials violated the right to free speech.  A federal appeals court later agreed with that ruling but narrowed its scope to include fewer federal officials. This is the second case the highest court in the country has thrown out because it did not believe the plaintiffs had the standing to sue. It also rejected a case involving the abortion drug mifepristone due to standing."
Surprise as Black Sabbath star joins Foo Fighters,"Foo Fighters fans were stunned when rock legend Geezer Butler joined the band on stage in Birmingham. The Black Sabbath bassist performed alongside Dave Grohl and the band for a rendition of their 1970s classic hit, Paranoid. The moment rounded off the West Midlands leg of the Fighters' UK tour on Thursday. Butler, who is from the city, was met with cheering and roars of support when he stepped out on stage at Villa Park Stadium. Fans took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to share videos of the ""epic"" performance. One wrote: ""Legend Geezer Butler back home."" ""What an epic show, Foo Fighters at Villa Park and bringing out Geezer Butler,"" another  commented. A third said: Bucket list band in the Foo Fighters checked off yesterday evening.

Suspected female suicide bombers kill at least 18 in Nigeria,"Amnesty International Nigeria called for an end to assaults on civilians in Borno. ""These deplorable attacks that took place at a time people were mourning demonstrate complete disregard for human life,"" it said. The US Mission in Nigeria also described the attack as ""horrific"". These reprehensible acts of violence show a cruel and heartless disregard for human lifethese abhorrent attacks are a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by terrorism in the region."" In the last four months, attackers have twice targeted people through suicide and improvised explosive devices in Borno state. Borno state has been at the centre of a 15-year insurgency by Boko Haram Islamist militants, which has displaced more than two million people and killed more than 40,000. Boko Haram gained international notoriety in April 2014 when it kidnapped more than 270 schoolgirls from the town of Chibok, also in Borno state. Shortly after the kidnapping, the group carried out an attack in June and used their first female suicide bomber. This was only three years after it deployed its first male suicide bomber. Since then, there have been speculations that some of the female suicide bombers may be the missing Chibok school girls. A study found that Boko Haram has utilised more women as suicide bombers than any other group in history. Recent numbers suggest that over half of all suicide bombers used by Boko Haram are female. Many suggest that their mode of dressing (usually in hijab  a covering from the head to the feet) offers adequate means for hiding explosives. Gwoza was seized by Boko Haram in 2014, and taken back by the Nigerian forces in 2015 - but the group has since continued to carry out attacks and kidnappings near the town. The Gwoza suicide attacks has reignited suspicions that jihadist groups may be trying to reinvent themselves and show that they still have the capacity to do damage. Last November, 20 people were killed by Boko Haram insurgents while returning from a funeral service in neighbouring Yobe state. The attack happened a day after militants killed 17 people in a raid on Gurokayeya village, after villagers refused to pay a so-called harvest tax, police said.

One of the bombings is reported to have killed six people and injured others at a wedding ceremony on Saturday, in the northeastern Borno state. The state's emergency management agency said the co-ordinated attacks targeted a wedding, the victims' subsequent funeral and a hospital in the town of Gwoza, close to the border of Cameroon. President Bola Tinubu condemned the attacks calling them ""desperate acts of terror"". He vowed stern action against those responsible for the killings in the town of Gwoza and insisted that the incident had not undermined recent gains made against jihadists. ""The president declares that the purveyors of wanton violence shall have a certain encounter with justice, and that these cowardly attacks are only but an isolated episode as his government will not allow the nation to slither into an era of fear, tears, sorrow, and blood,""  a statement issued by his spokesperson on Facebook said. No-one has admitted carrying out the attacks, but the Nigeria-centred Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) insurgents have previously claimed deadly bombings in Borno. Authorities said 18 deaths had been confirmed on Saturday, a toll that included children, adults and pregnant women. Some local media have reported a much higher toll - Nigeria's Vanguard and This Day newspapers said at least 30 had been killed in the blasts. The degree of injuries ranges from abdominal ruptures to skull and limb fractures. A curfew has been imposed by the military.

Suspects in Brazil judge kidnapping plot killed in jail,"Nefo and Rê, who were both 48 years old, were attacked while on a ""sunbathing break"" inside the prison compound, according to CNN Brasil. Nefo was stabbed to death in the toilets and Rê was killed in the courtyard, the news site reports. Three inmates confessed to the crime and handed themselves in to the prison authorities. They told officials they had killed the men in a ""settling of scores"". Both victims and their attackers are suspected of belonging to the First Capital Command (PCC), Brazil's most powerful criminal group. Brazilian news site UOL reports that the order to kill the two men would have come from ""high up"" in the PCC. According to UOL, Nefo and Rê were targeted because they had ""said too much"". They were detained in March 2023 when police uncovered the PCC's plan to kidnap Sergio Moro. Officials think he was singled out by the criminal group because, during his time as Brazil's justice and security minister, he ordered that high-ranking members of the gang be transferred from smaller penitentiaries that they controlled to maximum-security jails."

She added the show of solidarity had been spontaneous following message of support on social media. ""We are supposed to be supporting zero tolerance, but we seem to be supporting zero tolerance with caveats, and paramedics have the right to keep themselves safe as much as their patients,"" she said. ""We want recognition that emergency workers are allowed to make these decisions free of the fear that they are going to end up in court."" Mr Sutherland and Mr Le Sauteur remain suspended from duty.

Swimmers frightened to go in the sea due to sewage,"Langland Bay in Gower, Swansea county, attracts hundreds of swimmers and surfers, but swimming group leader Howard Jones said fewer people now wanted to take a dip. ""It's not just Langland, Caswell, Swansea, I'm hearing of children with ear infections or stomach infections. It's hard to pinpoint it. ""Certainly, in the last six months we've got more and more people complaining about this issue."" Sally Howells, 57,  travels from Cardiff to Gower to swim, and tracks alerts about sewage discharges. ""I'm frightened to go in to be perfectly honest,"" she said. ""It's a risk to go swimming."" Keen swimmer Rupert Miles, 62, said he thought his recent illnesses may have been linked to sea swimming. ""I've had a couple of bouts of rather nasty gastric flu, which I've been to the doctors about,"" he said. ""You don't want to point the blame, but they said 'you sea swim, it could be sewage'."" Caris Bowen, 32, coaches open-water swimming and prefers to teach in a spring water lake in Glynneath rather than the sea. ""I have to check an app on a daily basis to see if it's safe for us,"" she said. ""It's got a lot worse it's worrying. It's going to have a massive effect on my business."" When rainfall is heavy, treatment plants can discharge untreated sewage to prevent the system from being overwhelmed. However, if plants release more sewage than they are allowed to release, they could be in breach of their permits. Natural Resources Wales (NRW), who monitors water in Wales, was asked to comment but declined. Welsh Water, which provides services for the majority of communities in Wales, previously said the illegal discharge of untreated sewage was ""inevitable"" given the scale and age of its infrastructure. The water firm said by 2025 it would have invested over £1.4bn in its wastewater system and works closely with regulators. Many powers relating to the water industry are devolved in Wales, but Surfers Against Sewage activists said they wanted all politicians to work together. ""It's almost a daily occurrence that we're hearing about alleged illegal spillages,"" said Alun Moseley. ""We're hearing stories of people becoming sick. ""We've passed the point of hearing empty promises. We need to see change."" Welsh Water said it took responsibility for protecting bathing waters seriously and was investing in environmental projects. ""There are a number of contributing factors that impact on bathing and river water quality more generally. These include agricultural run-off and animal faeces, urban surface water drainage and misconnected drains,"" it said. ""We are committed to working closely with regulators and other sectors to ensure we do all we can to protect the environment."" Labour insisted its government in Wales was ""leading the charge"" to ""tackle all sources of pollution"". ""A UK Labour government will keep pushing for improvements, including by giving regulators the powers to block the payment of bonuses to executives who pollute our waterways."" The Conservatives said the UK government was ""holding water companies to task by subjecting polluters to unlimited penalties"". ""The Welsh Conservatives have long called for Labour and NRW to hold water firms to account and issue penalty fines."" Plaid Cymru cited an ""outdated sewerage network"" and ""lack of robust devolved powers"" in Wales. ""Plaid Cymru firmly believes that the supply and treatment of water in Wales should ultimately be managed by a single publicly-owned body,"" it said. ""We would also formally request powers from the UK government over the licensing of sewage in Wales."" While the Liberal Democrats have not yet released its manifesto in Wales, the UK branch of the party say it would ""strive towards protecting our rivers and coastlines"". ""It is a complete scandal that both the UK Conservative government and the Welsh Labour government have allowed water firms to get away with polluting our waterways here in Wales,"" it said. Reform UK said it ""would impose a proper system of regulation with very heavy fines for water companies that pollute our natural environment"". ""It is unacceptable that overseas shareholders get rich, while prices have soared, and raw sewage is pumped into our rivers and seas."" The Green Party said it was ""an utter scandal that people no longer feel safe to swim in our seas"". ""The only way to end this scandal is to bring the water companies back into public ownership."""
Swinney fears postal vote problems could affect election results,"On Friday City of Edinburgh Council announced it had opened an ""emergency"" voting facility at the city chambers, where voters still waiting for postal votes could have their voting pack re-issued or cast their vote on the spot, in privacy. The first minister said an estimated 25% of people in Scotland would vote by post and that he believed there would be a high number of ""very close contests"". He cited tight races in the 2017 general election such as Perth and North Perthshire where the margin was 21 votes and North East Fife where the winner was just two votes ahead of the second-placed candidate. Mr Swinney added: ""Individual votes count very, very significantly. ""I am troubled by what's happening with the postal ballot because in an election where there will be a number of marginal contests in Scotland, I'm worried that people will be left disenfranchised."" The Electoral Management Board for Scotland warned on Thursday that there had been ""many difficulties experienced with the delivery of postal votes"". A number of Scottish councils confirmed delays in ballots being received by voters, including Edinburgh, Fife and West Lothian. Perth and Kinross Council stated on social media it felt ""a comprehensive review of capacity and systems is necessary after the election"". Royal Mail said it had investigated concerns over the delivery of postal votes in some areas but had found no backlogs in any of its offices in Scotland. Many councils have been sending out postal ballots in tranches, with people who applied after 7 June having to wait longer before the ballot packs are despatched. Mr Swinney also said on the programme that it was ""crystal clear"" the best way to resolve debate over Scottish independence would be to hold another referendum on the matter. He was asked whether a failure to secure a majority of seats in the general election would be a signal from voters that the issue should not be pressed until the next Scottish elections in 2026. Mr Swinney replied that 2021 Holyrood elections had provided a ""clear mandate"" for a second referendum, but that the Westminster government had ""folded its arms and refused to engage"". He said: ""That is to deny democracy. I just think it would be healthy for our democracy if the United Kingdom government would actually engage, and enable the right of the people of Scotland to determine their own constitutional future."" He said he would look to take forward the controversial gender recognition bill in the event of there being an incoming Labour government but he insisted the ""safety of women and girls"" would be ""at the heart"" of his decision-making. The Scottish Parliament legislation was blocked by Conservative government at Westminster using a Section 35 order on grounds that it would interfere with the operation of the UK-wide Equality Act. The first minister was speaking ahead of the SNP launching its ""battle bus"" during the final week of campaigning for parties. Elsewhere in Scotland on Friday, the deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner attended a rally for Labours New Deal for Working People in Hamilton. Ms Rayner insisted the party's commitment to improve workers' rights was ""personal"" and recalled how as a single parent, the only job she could get was on a zero hours contract in the care sector. Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross hit the campaign trail in Peterhead, where he visited an offshore supply base and a seafood company. Scottish Liberal Democrats leader Alex Cole-Hamilton was in New Sefton to highlight the extent of sewage dumping in Scotland. And Scottish Greens co-convenor Patrick Harvie traveled to Strathaven where he met with a climate action community organisation."

Tamworth beatbox battle 'on international stage',"Artists from countries including Singapore, Belgium and the United States battled in the eight-hour Nue Beatbox final in Tamworth on Saturday. Nue said its competition, which begun in 2021, received 60 wildcard entries from 16 countries this year. Street artists also painted part of the Atik nightclub, where it was held. ""The event was a huge success and by far our best beatboxer competition to date,"" said Nue founder Vic Brown. ""Both final results have put Nue Beatbox firmly on the international stage and will definitely attract more international artists to the competition next year."" The solo beatboxer final was won by Stan from Belgium who explained he had ""mixed feelings"" about entering because he did not get through to the battle stage last year. ""So then making up my mind and winning the battles felt so satisfying, it's just hard to describe,"" he said. The event, which was also live-streamed, saw showcases from Hobbit and MC Zani from the Beatbox Collective. Smonal, from France, won the loopstation category, where artists use a device to record sounds and loop them to create longer pieces. The 16-year-old, who had posted his wildcard entry on his YouTube channel, described his win as ""awesome"" and unexpected as the competition was at ""such a high level"". ""Seeing the crowd enjoying what is actually months of preparation and hearing kind words from them was just amazingly pleasant,"" he said. ""Finally, the day itself was class, I was elated to meet all my beatboxer friends that I knew online. Even if I didn't win the event, it would still be an unforgettable memory."" Nue began its latest programme of arts events earlier this year after securing about £30,000 of funding. Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The influx came when Nue opened wildcard entries in the summer and received videos of people showcasing their vocal percussion skills. Nue founder Vic Brown said artists from nations including the US and Belgium applied to compete alongside UK talent. Beatbox Battles takes place at ATIK club on Spinning School Lane on 15 October from 13:00 BST. ""It's amazing to have received so many wildcards from overseas this year,"" Mr Brown said, adding it made the 2022 event ""international"". ""However we have also received plenty of homegrown wildcards from the UK who will be giving the overseas entrants a run for their money."" Judges have been looking through the entries and will choose 16 solo beatboxers to put through to the live finals. Eight will go through in the loopstation category, which is where artists use a device to record sounds and loop them to create longer pieces. Judges include Vocadah from the US and Hobbit from the UK. It is the latest project by Nue which has also held children's summer workshops and street art events this year.

Taunton and Wellington: All you need to know about new Somerset seat,"The new constituency of Taunton and Wellington effectively splits the former seat of Taunton Deane in half. The focus is now more firmly on the county town and the neighbouring market town of Wellington. It's because the western and entirely rural portion of the old constituency has become part of a new Tiverton and Minehead seat. All in all, the new Taunton and Wellington constituency is more urban than its predecessor, and geographically about half the size. There are lots of public sector workers in Taunton and Wellington with big employers including Musgrove Park Hospital, the UK Hydrographic Office, and one of Somerset's biggest employers - Somerset Council. This means the NHS is likely to be a big issue for local voters, as well as education. In recent years, small-scale industry has been growing in the area, as has house building. That's also the case in Wellington which has seen lots of new homes built and where a new train station is due to open next year.

On 4 July people in Somerset will vote in all-new constituencies with boundaries having been redrawn to even out the number of voters. Here is all you need to know about the new seat of Taunton and Wellington. The new constituency of Taunton and Wellington effectively splits the former seat of Taunton Deane in half. The focus is now more firmly on the county town and the neighbouring market town of Wellington. It's because the western and entirely rural portion of the old constituency has become part of a new Tiverton and Minehead seat. All in all, the new Taunton and Wellington constituency is more urban than its predecessor, and geographically about half the size. There are lots of public sector workers in Taunton and Wellington with big employers including Musgrove Park Hospital, the UK Hydrographic Office, and one of Somerset's biggest employers - Somerset Council. This means the NHS is likely to be a big issue for local voters, as well as education. In recent years, small-scale industry has been growing in the area, as has house building. That's also the case in Wellington which has seen lots of new homes built and where a new train station is due to open next year. Water quality and pollution has also been widely discussed in the area, with part of the River Tone recently being awarded Bathing Water Status by the Environment Agency.

Taxi drivers fear being 'priced out' of Cambridge,"Mohammed Irfan told the meeting through a statement he struggled to keep up with ""rocketing living costs"". He said his self-charging car was ""reliable and cost effective"", but raised concerns about the financial impact of buying a new vehicle. ""Over the last few years, for most months my income has averaged below the minimum wage, so it's been a real struggle to keep up with rocketing living costs and increased costs on debts and my mortgage as more bills pile up,"" Mr Irfan said. ""I accept we all have some responsibility to minimise the factors causing the devastation to our planet and the threat to our future generations... ""But I believe the current decision not to extend standard hybrids won't make much difference to Cambridge's air quality."" The city council said drivers had known about the policy change for years, with it first being agreed in 2018. Driver Cihan Bashan said he lived in a flat and would have to rely on ""pretty expensive"" public charging stations if he had to switch to a plug-in hybrid or fully electric car. Concerns were also raised that some drivers could be ""priced out"" of Cambridge if they faced even higher costs. Another driver said they would consider handing back their plates to the city council and gain a licence under a new authority. The meeting heard the city council had declared a climate emergency and drivers were told to contact the authority if taxis from other areas were using ranks in Cambridge.

The new policy requires taxi drivers to buy an ultra-low emission or electric car when they need to replace their existing vehicles. Due to issues around the availability of the cars, the city council agreed in 2022 to delay the change for two years. Drivers called for another review after they told the licensing committee they faced financial struggles, but a majority of councillors voted in favour of keeping the policy change.

Technology research project for elderly launched,"Through interactive light projections, residents can experience physical, social and cognitive activities at the Magic Table, such as solving puzzles, playing games and tactile challenges. The project also includes virtual reality headsets which offer residents virtual day trips and experiences. Mark Stainton, adult social care and health director at the council, said he hoped residents enjoyed the innovative project. The feedback gathered from the pilot scheme will enable us and our partners at the University of Brighton and NHS Sussex to learn how internet-connected devices could help improve the health of older people living locally, as well as see first-hand the positive impact this technology can have on their quality of life, he said. In addition, clients can opt to have heat sensor fall monitors installed in their apartments or try a sport Smartwatch to monitor their health. It is hoped the technology will also help ease the pressure felt by carers by providing talking points and encouraging interaction between clients and carers, the council said. The pilot project is being delivered in partnership with the council, NHS Sussex and the University of Brighton. Dr Theo Fotis, lead researcher at the universitys School of Sport and Health Sciences, said: ""The Living Lab concept allows us to work with all the relevant stakeholders to co-create and conduct the testing of these technologies in a real-world setting, gathering valuable insights from the residents themselves.""

Teenagers guilty of killing boy in 'spiteful' stabbing,"Four teenagers have been been found guilty of stabbing a 16-year-old boy to death in a ""spiteful attack"" one street away from his home. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said Kennie Carter suffered one stab wound to the chest on Thirlmere Avenue in Stretford, Trafford, on 22 January 2022 and later died in hospital. A 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found guilty of his murder at Manchester Crown Court. Two other 16-year-olds, who also cannot be named, and 18-year-old Latif Ferguson, of Old Trafford, were all found guilty of manslaughter. GMP said Kennie was one street away from his home when he was attacked by a group of boys, who had travelled from about three miles from Hulme ""looking for retribution"" following an incident the evening before. A force representative said the group went to a block of flats where they knew Kennies friends would be and stole three bikes. They said a witness heard them shout ""this is revenge"". They said Kennie knew the group was in the area and passed them as he walked home. ""At that moment, he became their focus,"" they added. The force said more than 20 warrants were executed during its investigation and a number of appeals were made, one of which offered a £50,000 reward. Six others teenagers, who were aged between 15 and 19, were found not guilty of charges related to Kennie's death. Following the convictions, Kennie's mother Joan Dixon said he had ""brightened up every day with his cheeky smile and bubbly personality"". ""He was always acting daft, telling jokes and generally being a 16-year-old boy,"" she said. ""He had everything to live for."" She said he was the youngest of four children and was about to start applying for college to pursue his passion for designing artwork on cars. ""He was a very talented artist,"" she said. ""I hadnt realised how artistic he was until one of his teachers showed us his drawings and they were genuinely impressive."" She said life since the day of his murder had ""not been the same"". ""Every day I wake up thinking of him. I dream about him regularly,"" she said. ""Life has stopped for us and will never ever be the same."" Det Ch Insp Nicola McCulloch said it had been ""extremely difficult"" to get those responsible for the ""spiteful attack"" in court and their continued denials had caused Kennie's family further pain. ""Theyve had to watch and listen to Kennies last moments many times,"" she said. ""[That is] something no family should have to experience."" Sentencing will take place on 26 July.

The Tour de France champion who saved hundreds of Jews,"Piazzale Michelangelo, nicknamed ""the balcony of Florence"" for its expansive views over the Tuscan capital from its vantage point just over the Arno river, will take centre stage at the Tour de Frances Grand Depart on 29 June. This is where teams of elite cyclists will be presented to masses of fans before the official race departure from Piazza della Signoria in the historic city centre. This is the Tours first departure from Italy, and locals simply cannot wait. For bicycle-mad Italy, having just hosted the Giro dItalia, this is truly an occasion to be proud of. ""I am incredibly excited about the Grand Departure in Florence and believe that the Tour de France could only start from here and from the beauty of Tuscany, a true land of cycling,"" said Silvia Livoni, cycle tourism consultant for Tuscanys tourism agency, Toscana Promozione Turistica. And for Florence, it's the perfect opportunity to celebrate their own cycling hero, three-time Giro dItalia and two-time Tour de France winner, Gino Bartali, who is also being officially honoured as part of the Tour's promotion. Born in 1914 in Ponte a Ema, a small town near Florence, Bartali grew up to become one of the greatest cyclists in history. As a child, Bartali cycled up to Piazzale Michelangelo with his brother Giulio to admire the beautiful domes of Florence, dreaming of one day being a great racer. Unknown to the small boy at the time, he would be remembered not only as one of the best, but also as something a lot more. When he passed in 2000, the Guardian described him as the ""icon of Italian cycle racing"" and focused their obituary on his cycling prowess and achievements. What the obituary did not mention, nor did any other media at the time, however, was the secret life Bartali lived during World War Two, when he risked his own safety to save the lives of persecuted Jews and dissident refugees. Between 1943 and 1945, as part of a religious underground network, Bartali cycled thousands of kilometres couriering fake identity documents covertly printed by an underground movement led by his friend Archbishop of Florence Cardinal Dalla Costa. They were being delivered to Jewish and other political refugees to help them escape Nazi-controlled northern Italy. Donning his race jersey with his name printed across the back and leaving home with only emergency tools for the bike, he rode thousands of miles from Florence to Genoa and Assisi carrying this precious cargo. Based on this act alone, he is credited for saving the lives of more than 500 people. For Bartali, his status as a champion cyclist was the ultimate disguise. Whenever he was stopped enroute, he would simply say ""I am training"", and no one questioned him further. Bartali was fighting the regime that had initially used his cycling for politics. His win at the Tour de France in 1938 was used as propaganda by Italys fascist regime to ""prove"" the might of the Italian race, and his bicycle became his defiant weapon against a government he did not support  especially when Italy introduced a racial policy that year to exclude Jews from schooling and employment. When Italian dictator Benito Mussolini praised him for winning the race, Bartali chose not to respond, dedicating his win to the Catholic church instead. When World War Two broke out, Italys fascist regime allied with Nazi Germany and began to implement the arrest of Jews in Italy. The partisan rebels were particularly strong in Tuscany because the region was on the edge of where Allies were advancing from the south and the Germans from the north. Like many Tuscans who opposed the racial ideal policy, Bartali was given the opportunity to help. Tuscany is a great region for cycling, whether following the challenges of the Tour de France route or for a simple pleasure ride around the gorgeous countryside. Try these four trail ideas to get a glimpse into Bartali's world: 1. Florence to Ponte a Ema: It's a short 8km ride along the river and through country roads to Bartalis hometown, where you can visit the museum and enjoy the quieter side of Florence along the way. 2. Challenge Tour de France: Follow this years Tour and take the challenging first climb to Valico Tre Faggi on the border of Emilia-Romagna. Start from Dicomano by car or train to avoid the traffic coming out of Florence. 3. Ciclopista del Trammino: The Trammino cycle path begins at Pisa and follows an old railway line all the way to the sea. An easy and enjoyable day trip suitable for all cycling abilities. 4. Volcanic mountain biking: One of Tuscany's dormant volcanoes, Monte Amiata, has a fantastic network of mountain bike trails, including the opportunity to relax at a natural hot spring at the end of the day. Travellers can see proof of this at Terontola Train station, about 110km south of Florence, where there's a plaque dedicated to Bartali. Other than being a courier, Bartali's champion status allowed him to work with partisans to create a paparazzi scenario that distracted soldiers and guards away from the train carriages so refugees could board and hide until the train reached the free south. Yet, he kept this life a secret for most of his life after the war. Bartali believed that by talking up his good deeds, he betrayed the people he had helped as it became an act of self-promotion rather than genuine intentions. ""He never told anyone besides me, making me swear not to tell anyone,"" Ginos son, Andrea, recalled in the 2014 film My Italian Secret, a documentary about the brave acts of unsung heroes during the war. Andrea was already in his 30s and, other than those directly affected, was the first person Bartali told of what exactly happened during the war. After Bartalis death in 2000, his story came out piece by piece through his son, his friends and those whom he had helped, including Giorgio Goldenberg who, as a boy along with his family, Bartali had hidden in his basement to escape capture. Since then, books and films have been made to tell Bartalis story, as well as a West End musical that ran for a season in London in 2023. Gino did not see himself as a hero, Andrea says in the film, recalling his father's words: ""I want to be remembered for my sporting achievements. Real heroes are others, those who have suffered in their soul, in their heart, in their spirit, in their mind, for their loved ones. Those are the real heroes. I'm just a cyclist."" Maurizio Bresci, president of the Gino Bartali Cycling Museum, recalls his father, Andrea Bresci, who was a friend of Bartali, first mentioning the idea of opening a museum in Bartali's honour in 1986. ""At first, Gino didnt agree with the idea,"" Maurizio told me. The idea was well received at the time by Bartali's friends and family, the media and the public, but it still took a while to convince the great cyclist. ""Gino finally said OK, but it must be a cycling museum for all the cyclists, not only for me."" More like this:  Is Italy breaking up with you?  The Cuban building the worlds tallest bike  The stunning Tuscan town even Italians don't know The museum opened in 2006 in Ponte a Ema with exhibits including newspaper clippings, athlete cards, personal documents, bicycles, photographs and the 1948 Tour de France trophy, which Bartali himself donated to the museum. When Andrea passed away in 2020, Maurizio took over the museums presidency and continued his fathers work of preserving Bartali's story. With limited workforce and funds, the museum is still a work in progress. ""This is my life, my passion,"" Maurizio said, ""to keep Ginos story alive."" Bartali's story will get a moment in the international spotlight when the grand prix of cycling races through Ponte a Ema on 29 June. For the Tour de France, Bartali is the iron cyclist who won the race twice, once before and once after World War Two, both at the height of political unrest. The gap of 10 years between his victories is a record that no one else has achieved. It should be an exciting time for the museum, however for political reasons, the Tour is not promoting Bartali's life-saving work, focusing only on his cycling achievements. However, it is clear that Tuscany is hugely proud of the champion, and locals hope that tourists will pause to learn how Bartali's selfless actions changed the lives of so many. ""I believe that the Grand Depart from Florence is significant not only for Florentines but for all Tuscans and Italians and for the whole world,"" said Livoni, ""And it is rightful to dedicate this to Bartali, to tell his story today in order to make people understand his human depth. I hope his story inspires people to stand up for what they believe in, even when it's difficult."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter  a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

With this year's Tour de France starting in Florence, it's the perfect opportunity to celebrate the city's cycling hero: two-time Tour de France winner, Gino Bartali. Piazzale Michelangelo, nicknamed ""the balcony of Florence"" for its expansive views over the Tuscan capital from its vantage point just over the Arno river, will take centre stage at the Tour de Frances Grand Depart on 29 June. This is where teams of elite cyclists will be presented to masses of fans before the official race departure from Piazza della Signoria in the historic city centre. This is the Tours first departure from Italy, and locals simply cannot wait. For bicycle-mad Italy, having just hosted the Giro dItalia, this is truly an occasion to be proud of. ""I am incredibly excited about the Grand Departure in Florence and believe that the Tour de France could only start from here and from the beauty of Tuscany, a true land of cycling,"" said Silvia Livoni, cycle tourism consultant for Tuscanys tourism agency, Toscana Promozione Turistica. And for Florence, it's the perfect opportunity to celebrate their own cycling hero, three-time Giro dItalia and two-time Tour de France winner, Gino Bartali, who is also being officially honoured as part of the Tour's promotion. Born in 1914 in Ponte a Ema, a small town near Florence, Bartali grew up to become one of the greatest cyclists in history. As a child, Bartali cycled up to Piazzale Michelangelo with his brother Giulio to admire the beautiful domes of Florence, dreaming of one day being a great racer. Unknown to the small boy at the time, he would be remembered not only as one of the best, but also as something a lot more. When he passed in 2000, the Guardian described him as the ""icon of Italian cycle racing"" and focused their obituary on his cycling prowess and achievements. What the obituary did not mention, nor did any other media at the time, however, was the secret life Bartali lived during World War Two, when he risked his own safety to save the lives of persecuted Jews and dissident refugees. Between 1943 and 1945, as part of a religious underground network, Bartali cycled thousands of kilometres couriering fake identity documents covertly printed by an underground movement led by his friend Archbishop of Florence Cardinal Dalla Costa. They were being delivered to Jewish and other political refugees to help them escape Nazi-controlled northern Italy. Donning his race jersey with his name printed across the back and leaving home with only emergency tools for the bike, he rode thousands of miles from Florence to Genoa and Assisi carrying this precious cargo. Based on this act alone, he is credited for saving the lives of more than 500 people. For Bartali, his status as a champion cyclist was the ultimate disguise. Whenever he was stopped enroute, he would simply say ""I am training"", and no one questioned him further. Bartali was fighting the regime that had initially used his cycling for politics. His win at the Tour de France in 1938 was used as propaganda by Italys fascist regime to ""prove"" the might of the Italian race, and his bicycle became his defiant weapon against a government he did not support  especially when Italy introduced a racial policy that year to exclude Jews from schooling and employment. When Italian dictator Benito Mussolini praised him for winning the race, Bartali chose not to respond, dedicating his win to the Catholic church instead. When World War Two broke out, Italys fascist regime allied with Nazi Germany and began to implement the arrest of Jews in Italy. The partisan rebels were particularly strong in Tuscany because the region was on the edge of where Allies were advancing from the south and the Germans from the north. Like many Tuscans who opposed the racial ideal policy, Bartali was given the opportunity to help. Cycling in Tuscany Tuscany is a great region for cycling, whether following the challenges of the Tour de France route or for a simple pleasure ride around the gorgeous countryside. Try these four trail ideas to get a glimpse into Bartali's world: 1. Florence to Ponte a Ema: It's a short 8km ride along the river and through country roads to Bartalis hometown, where you can visit the museum and enjoy the quieter side of Florence along the way. 2. Challenge Tour de France: Follow this years Tour and take the challenging first climb to Valico Tre Faggi on the border of Emilia-Romagna. Start from Dicomano by car or train to avoid the traffic coming out of Florence. 3. Ciclopista del Trammino: The Trammino cycle path begins at Pisa and follows an old railway line all the way to the sea. An easy and enjoyable day trip suitable for all cycling abilities. 4. Volcanic mountain biking: One of Tuscany's dormant volcanoes, Monte Amiata, has a fantastic network of mountain bike trails, including the opportunity to relax at a natural hot spring at the end of the day. Travellers can see proof of this at Terontola Train station, about 110km south of Florence, where there's a plaque dedicated to Bartali. Other than being a courier, Bartali's champion status allowed him to work with partisans to create a paparazzi scenario that distracted soldiers and guards away from the train carriages so refugees could board and hide until the train reached the free south. Yet, he kept this life a secret for most of his life after the war. Bartali believed that by talking up his good deeds, he betrayed the people he had helped as it became an act of self-promotion rather than genuine intentions. ""He never told anyone besides me, making me swear not to tell anyone,"" Ginos son, Andrea, recalled in the 2014 film My Italian Secret, a documentary about the brave acts of unsung heroes during the war. Andrea was already in his 30s and, other than those directly affected, was the first person Bartali told of what exactly happened during the war. After Bartalis death in 2000, his story came out piece by piece through his son, his friends and those whom he had helped, including Giorgio Goldenberg who, as a boy along with his family, Bartali had hidden in his basement to escape capture. Since then, books and films have been made to tell Bartalis story, as well as a West End musical that ran for a season in London in 2023. Gino did not see himself as a hero, Andrea says in the film, recalling his father's words: ""I want to be remembered for my sporting achievements. Real heroes are others, those who have suffered in their soul, in their heart, in their spirit, in their mind, for their loved ones. Those are the real heroes. I'm just a cyclist."" Maurizio Bresci, president of the Gino Bartali Cycling Museum, recalls his father, Andrea Bresci, who was a friend of Bartali, first mentioning the idea of opening a museum in Bartali's honour in 1986. ""At first, Gino didnt agree with the idea,"" Maurizio told me. The idea was well received at the time by Bartali's friends and family, the media and the public, but it still took a while to convince the great cyclist. ""Gino finally said OK, but it must be a cycling museum for all the cyclists, not only for me."" More like this:  Is Italy breaking up with you?  The Cuban building the worlds tallest bike  The stunning Tuscan town even Italians don't know The museum opened in 2006 in Ponte a Ema with exhibits including newspaper clippings, athlete cards, personal documents, bicycles, photographs and the 1948 Tour de France trophy, which Bartali himself donated to the museum. When Andrea passed away in 2020, Maurizio took over the museums presidency and continued his fathers work of preserving Bartali's story. With limited workforce and funds, the museum is still a work in progress. ""This is my life, my passion,"" Maurizio said, ""to keep Ginos story alive."" Bartali's story will get a moment in the international spotlight when the grand prix of cycling races through Ponte a Ema on 29 June. For the Tour de France, Bartali is the iron cyclist who won the race twice, once before and once after World War Two, both at the height of political unrest. The gap of 10 years between his victories is a record that no one else has achieved. It should be an exciting time for the museum, however for political reasons, the Tour is not promoting Bartali's life-saving work, focusing only on his cycling achievements. However, it is clear that Tuscany is hugely proud of the champion, and locals hope that tourists will pause to learn how Bartali's selfless actions changed the lives of so many. ""I believe that the Grand Depart from Florence is significant not only for Florentines but for all Tuscans and Italians and for the whole world,"" said Livoni, ""And it is rightful to dedicate this to Bartali, to tell his story today in order to make people understand his human depth. I hope his story inspires people to stand up for what they believe in, even when it's difficult."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter  a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

The UK taxi driver still being paid as a Nigerian civil servant,"Like Mr Adams, more than 3.6 million Nigerians have relocated to other countries over the last two years, according to official statistics. Many young Nigerians see little prospect of earning a good living in the country - a feeling exacerbated by the collapse in the value of the naira over the past year following the reforms introduced by Mr Tinubu since he became president. It has become so common for young people to seek their fortunes outside the country, the term japa has been coined to describe the phenomenon. It is a word from the Yoruba language meaning to escape or flee. Mr Tinubu said he was ""struck by the revelations the head of the civil service shared regarding employees who had relocated abroad while drawing salaries without formally resigning"". The president said that not only should the money be repaid but those who were complicit in allowing it to happened should be investigated too. Their supervisors and department heads must also be punished for aiding and abetting the fraud under their watch, he said. And this may have been the case for Mr Adams. The UK-based taxi driver admitted that he continued to be paid thanks to those in his department: I had a good understanding with my boss and he just let me leave."" Often in such cases the salary is divided between the supervisor who keeps quiet and the person being paid, maybe along with an HR representative. But for Mr Adams it was even easier. ""In my case it wasnt like that as my boss was a relative."" So-called ""ghost-working"" is a major problem in Nigeria. Despite several crackdowns it is believed that thousands of non-existent workers are still being paid. There appear to be very few checks and balances in place. But this is the first time it has been suggested that people who have moved abroad are continuing to be paid their salaries on a large scale. Auwal Yakasai, who retired as a director in charge of finance at Kano state's information ministry in 2021, said he had heard of such cases. ''To be honest I have never caught anyone red-handed, Mr Yakasai, who worked for the government for 32 years, told the BBC. But I have heard numerous stories of such arrangements, where someone would still be receiving [a] salary after relocating or changing their place of work. Since he took office in May last year, Mr Tinubu has pledged to reduce the cost of governance and cut wastage. In January, he directed that all official entourages to state and international events for himself and other government officials be slashed by 60%. Nonetheless some have noted that there is much talk in Mr Tinubus administration without much action. They cite plans to buy new planes worth millions of dollars for Mr Tinubu and his deputy Kashim Shettima as an example. Another was when Mr Tinubu earlier this month launched a new official residence for Vice-President Shettima in the capital, Abuja, with a price tag of $13.6m (£11m). And despite the president's statement about the foreign ghost-workers, he did not say exactly what he was doing to crack down on them and take action against those responsible.

They have managed to be employed elsewhere - sometimes in another country entirely - and yet continue to receive a wage from their former workplace. News of this has reached the top and last week President Bola Tinubu ordered a crackdown. The culprits must be made to refund the money they have fraudulently collected, he said. Sabitu Adams, whose name we have changed to protect his identity, has not resigned from his position as a junior official at a government agency and still gets paid each month, despite leaving Nigeria two years ago. He now works as a taxi driver in the UK, but told the BBC that he was not worried about losing the salary as he sees Mr Tinubus comments as an empty threat. Mr Adams added that the loss of his monthly Nigerian salary of 150,000 naira ($100; £80) would not be a great hardship, as he earns a lot more driving a taxi. When I heard about the president's directive, I smiled because I know I am doing better here - and not worried, the 36-year-old said. But why not make it clear to the civil service that he had left? To be honest I didnt resign because I wanted to leave that door open in case I choose to go back to my job after a few years. Like Mr Adams, more than 3.6 million Nigerians have relocated to other countries over the last two years, according to official statistics.

The big problem facing whoever wins the election,"The Honda site is set to become a warehousing and logistics facility. In another world, it would have been replaced by another major global manufacturer. Tesla, for example, was invited. Whereas five years ago the promise was to level up left-behind Northern towns, places like Swindon feel levelled down. The question about growth arising in this town is vital to whoever wins Thursdays election. Elsewhere in the world, sites like this are being repurposed for electric car manufacturing. The Americans are pouring public money into their factories to try to compete with China, who will soon be confirmed as the worlds biggest car exporter. Emerging economies from Indonesia to Vietnam to Turkey are also investing in and growing their car industries. Indeed it was to Turkey that the entire Honda production line, including dozens of never-used industrial robots, was packed up and shipped off via the M4 and Bristol port last year. Swindon is not just about Honda. It is part of the M4 corridor where there are plenty of jobs in the knowledge sectors, and in finance, for example at the headquarters of Nationwide. The overall unemployment rate is just 2.6%, but the number of people not in work and not looking for work is 18%. Marcus Kittridge, a former Honda engineer who now runs a cafe in the centre of town with his wife Tracey, accepts there are still good employment prospects but says many are at or 50p above minimum wage, and says this has contributed to a decline in disposable income in the centre of town. Its like a Northern town that lost its industry in the 1970s, he tells me. They now shut the cafe at 14:00 every day because of the high price of energy. He expects to be passing on his rising costs in higher prices for the next year or two. They have also stopped selling smoothies, after a notable decline in the availability and quality of fresh fruit, which they blame on post-Brexit changes. We were told the quality of food was going to go up after Brexit, I can tell you now it has not. Ive barely heard any politician mention it, but it definitely has had an impact on us, Tracey says. Might she have been a bit unlucky with her purchases of fresh produce? If Im unlucky, Im getting unlucky every single day and Im probably the unluckiest person on earth, she says. Their experience shows that some of the undercurrents of sluggish long-term growth - high energy prices, low disposable income, low investment, and new trade barriers can combine in unusual ways. Gary Huett, a retired graphic designer also from Swindon who got in touch as part of the BBC's Your Voice, Your Vote project inviting you to tell us what matters, wanted to know why Swindons town centre looked like it was rotting and asked if anything could change. Weve now got pound shops predominantly, and the thriving night scene, packed with the yuppy set in the 1980s and 1990s has gone and decayed. The Conservatives say green shoots are already here. The latest growth figures for January to March show the UK now has the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of advanced economies, after last years brief recession. Swindons jobs record remains strong. On the Honda site, new investment has come, and the jobs, albeit in warehousing rather than manufacturing, will return. For Labour, Swindon - a bellwether town where residents have voted the same way as the eventual national winner for the last 40 years - shows that there are no quick fixes. They are not competing with the US or European Union (EU) with big public investments in green energy. Council spending remains unprotected and subject to the same ongoing squeeze. A looser planning regime might help build more houses or expand the solar farms that dot the countryside around the town. But the job of transformation is very real. When asked what will happen if the economy does not grow, Labour has responded by saying some variation of Im not defeatist or we can do it. When I interviewed shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves in Swindon, I said that if she was relying on planning changes to transform growth prospects, they were going to have to be a revolutionary, almost Thatcher-style ""Big Bang"". She told me: Its big reform we are offering unless we grow the economy were going to be stuck in a doom loop of low growth, high taxes and poor public services. Labours hope is that there is a tsunami of private investment that has been held back from this country due to political and economic instability. That, the party says, can be unleashed by the tens of billions with a strong and stable pro-growth government. When I met Chancellor Jeremy Hunt on the same day in Surrey, he said the partys focus was now on bringing tax  which his party had hiked to seven-decade highs  down. We put up taxes because we were helping families in the cost-of-living crisis. We were very honest about that, it was the right thing to do. The difference is we dont think it has to be permanent, and we are prepared to do the hard work to bring taxes down because we know a more competitive economy will see more growth and then more money for the NHS and schools. Whoever is in Number 11 after the election, Swindon shows the massive task facing them. It shows what an economy not growing at normal rates looks like. A former boom town struggling. The challenge is not just to deliver robust economic growth here and well beyond, but to make sure this renewal is visible to the likes of Gary, Tracey and Marcus here in Swindon and to others like them across the country. You can find a full list of candidates for the Swindon North constituency here, and those for the Swindon South constituency here. Amid a vast expanse of rubble, dust and noise, a green crane yanks away at a corrugated roof like a frustrated dentist attempting to extract a particularly stubborn wisdom tooth. Swindons Honda factory - once one of the worlds most advanced car factories - is being demolished, three decades after it opened. This used to be one of the fastest-growing towns in Europe. It was one of the jewels in the crown of investments attracted to the UK by Margaret Thatchers brand of 1980s enterprise. Swindon voted for her, John Major, Tony Blair, David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson. It was also one of the first towns to declare for Brexit, by 55%. But last year, its council changed hands to Labour. The council has had to continue to accelerate cuts to local services, passing a budget with record cuts in order to stave off bankruptcy. Inflation, rising care expenses, and central government grant squeezes meant cuts to libraries, the Dial-a-Ride community transport service and dimmed street lights. There has been an almost 5% rise in council tax. The council leader has warned any further cuts will affect frontline services. What is happening in Swindon is a visible consequence of sluggish long-term economic growth. Government spending cuts, low private investment, deindustrialisation and shrinking disposable income have left scars even on what was one of the UKs famous boom towns.

The communities asking for more help to tackle crime,"One of her sons is currently addicted to drugs while another child regularly skips school. She feels lost and doesn't know where to turn next. ""It's not every young person on this estate and its not just this estate. ""Its all over the town and not just this town, all over the country,"" she explains about the problems. Her biggest fear about her son's future? ""That he might not have one,"" Claire says. Her biggest request from any future government? ""They need to stop putting the effort into the tourist areas. ""I understand thats how our town works, but think about the community that lives here. ""We need more help, we need help with housing, support towards charities instead of putting statues up in places."" She says there is a police presence but that it doesn't seem to have an effect. ""The police basically just walk around the estate,"" she says. ""But I don't know what more they can do; once they get rid of one drug dealer another one comes along. ""It's like an infestation, basically."" Away from the coast in the York suburb of Haxby, residents tell us they are suffering from the blight of anti-social behaviour. The people we spoke to there cited large groups of youths regularly causing trouble. They have been caught on CCTV throwing rocks at cars and bricks through windows. One man says he felt it ""harrowing"" that the incidents were happening  and police needed to step up and deal with it. ""We've been scared to leave our cars on the drive, fearful that at any point there could be a brick coming through the window."" Cafe owner Tina Clayton, who runs Haxby Bakehouse, advises her staff to close the shop if they feel intimidated by anti-social behaviour. She says: ""If I've seen on social media that there have been issues, I often think, 'oh Lord, when I get to work will the windows have gone through, will there be a mess everywhere?'"" The Costa Coffee outlet next door has similar problems, with young people seen throwing tables and chairs around outside when they have been told they won't be served. Manager Chris Vessey says: ""If there are certain ones who try to come in and I turn them away, we will get issues out here. ""Recently we have had them throwing the chairs and tables all over, and using the takeaways that they have been getting, drawing on the windows with chicken and chips, throwing pop all over the windows. It's something we need to crack down on."" Although these incidents have been reported to police, residents and businesses say nothing has been done about it. They want a stronger police presence to deter the youths, but they know this is a big ask when resources are limited. Data shows that the two areas with the highest rates of reports of anti-social behaviour in our region between April 2023 and March 2024 are what were the constituencies of Scarborough and Whitby plus York Central. Insp Lucy McNeill of North Yorkshire Police has worked in Scarborough for almost all of her 21-year career in uniform. She notices that complaints tend to be reporting adults drinking on the street or bored youths behaving anti-socially. She believes that tighter restrictions on underage entry to bars and nightclubs and changing habits have led to more young people spending time on the streets. ""I think the way people drink and choose to go out has changed as well. A lot of people drink at home and come out into the town later. ""I believe a lot of the clubs that kids used to go to aren't as freely accessible now, so that has changed."" The officer also believes that increased reporting of crime could be attributed to improved confidence in the police's response. North Yorkshire Police's Chief Constable, Tim Forber, accepts that there are issues with drugs and youth behaviour in areas of Scarborough and York. He says one of the keys to reduce crime is communities and police working together. ""We absolutely recognise the impact that anti-social behaviour has on local residents,"" he explains. ""It is really important that we have neighbourhood policing teams that are fully attuned to the issues in those local areas and work with communities to do something about it. ""I take anti-social behaviour deadly seriously."" For Claire, the outcome of pledges by police and politicians can sometimes feel very far away. My son has lost quite a few friends from drugs and it still hasnt made him open his eyes. I dont know what else I can do, it's heartbreaking. Growing up on this estate is very scary, she adds. During a live pre-election debate on Look North on Thursday, the parliamentary candidates for the Scarborough and Whitby constituency explained what they would do to tackle anti-social behaviour. Roberto Weeden-Sanz, for the Conservatives, said: ""It's clear we need to do more to support people of all ages who get addicted to drugs to get them off the streets, get them clean and back on their feet so they can meet their full potential. ""We've got £20m that the government has given us to invest in the town centre in Scarborough and making sure that goes towards tackling anti-social behaviour and other issues that affect young people is key."" Labour's Alison Hume said: ""We'll crack down on persistent offenders. ""We'll give young people the chance to improve their lives through our new youth hubs, allowing them to work with mental health professionals and career advisers. ""We'll put social workers in A&E departments to stop children and young people falling into the clutches of crime groups."" The Liberal Democrats' Robert Graham Lockwood said: ""Prevention is better than cure. ""We previously had crime and disorder officers in North Yorkshire and we had a very low crime rate in North Yorkshire compared to places in the big cities. ""We need a six-month funding youth opportunities programme, as it was in 1978, where young people can do any job they like for six months."" Lee Derrick of the Yorkshire Party said: ""We've got to get back to the grassroots. ""The education system needs a complete overhaul. We're producing parrots. We've got our kids to learn (for) exams. ""We're not giving them vocational experience, testing their curiosity or giving them opportunities and options."" David Bowes of Reform UK said: ""We'd have a zero tolerance approach to anti-social behaviour. ""Children and families don't want to be in the street with alcoholism and anti-social behaviour going on around them. ""We need more bobbies on the beat - 40,000 new officers in five years - and high-intensity training camps for young offenders."" Asa Jones of the Social Justice Party said: ""Britain is broken and people have lost a sense of stake in our society. ""It leaves them more vulnerable to engaging in criminal activities. ""We need more police but we also need to invest in our criminal justice system to make sure we can prosecute crimes properly.""

The election battleground in Coventry and Warwickshire,"A complete list of candidates standing in each constituency is available on the BBC website. Here is an overview of each constituency, in alphabetical order: Therell be a new MP whatever happens in Coventry East, where Labours Coleen Fletcher stood down from the constituency after nine years. Formerly called Coventry North East, the seat was renamed and subject to boundary changes. The areas constituency in every guise has been a Labour stronghold, with the Conservatives finishing second. Spanning the entire city centre, Coventry South covers the iconic cathedral and the university, which means theres a significant student vote in the constituency. Labours Zarah Sultana was elected to the seat in 2019, winning with a wafer-thin majority of 401 votes. Its the closest the Tories ever came to taking the seat, which has been an impenetrable Labour fortress since the mid-20th century. Just 208 votes separated the top two candidates in 2019 - the smallest majority in Coventry and Warwickshire. Labours Taiwo Owatemi came out on top, replacing the long-time incumbent and former cabinet minister Geoffrey Robinson. There are no boundary changes here so this election will be fought on the same terms as in 2019. The constituency was created in 2010, with Sir Jeremy Wright winning the seat for the Conservatives at every general election since. Its a large and overwhelmingly rural area thats considered to be one of the safest Conservative seats, having last been taken by Labour in 1997 when it was known as Rugby and Kenilworth. Boundary changes mean it has adsorbed some villages from neighbouring Warwick and Leamington, and vice versa. With a history of mining and heavy industry, North Warwickshire & Bedworth is another one to watch for a potential swing back to Labour from the Conservatives. The renamed constituency - previously called North Warwickshire - has been held by Conservative Craig Tracey since 2015. But the seat was in Labour hands for almost two decades a few years before and during the New Labour era, when Tony Blair was prime minister. Nuneaton has traditionally been a bellwether seat, meaning it usually backs the winning party nationally in general elections. Marcus Jones has been the MP for Nuneaton since 2010, and in 2015, former Prime Minister David Cameron said his victory in the seat was the moment he knew the Conservatives had won the general election that year. With a population thats seen as broadly representative of the country as a whole, Nuneaton will be watched closely on election night. Known for its connection to the sport that shares its name, Rugby has been in Conservative hands since the seat's creation in 2010. But with the departure of long-standing MP Mark Pawsey, who has won handsome majorities for the Conservatives at every election, Labour is eyeing up the seat. Progress on the regeneration of the town centre and the lack of A&E services at the main local hospital are two big issues in this part of the world. Famously the birthplace of William Shakeperare, Stratford is a relatively affluent town in south Warwickshire and has been rock-solid Conservative territory for decades. The former cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi had held the seat since 2010, winning a comfortable majority of 19,972 at the last election. But after Mr Zawhawi stood down, the Liberal Democrats have high hopes of taking the seat, especially after winning control of Stratford-on-Avon District Council last year. The seat has flipped between Labour and Conservative since 1997. Until then, it had historically been a Conservative safe seat, and was once held by former Tory Prime Minister Sir Anthony Eden. Labours Matt Western has been the incumbent since 2017, but boundary changes mean voters who were in Tory-leaning Kenilworth and Southam have been brought into the constituency. Voters in Coventry and Warwickshire will pick nine MPs in the snap general election called by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak. Labour was dominant with three MPs in Coventry, while the Tories held five of six seats in Warwickshire before the 4 July election was announced. Two veteran Tory MPs have stood down, with former chancellor Nadhim Zahawi and Mark Pawsey vacating their seats.

The hidden wonders of Mexico's sacred underwater world,"Mexico's cenotes are a uniquely beautiful and complex system of caves and waterways that are home to an abundance of flora and fauna ­ some not found anywhere else in the world. These 7,000-plus limestone sinkholes have been forming in the Yucatan Peninsula for millions of years, dating to the Chicxulub asteroid impact that wiped out nearly all dinosaur life. Cenotes have been cherished throughout history. For more than 2,500 years, the Maya used some as water wells and others as sacred sites. They believed them to be the gateway to Xibalba, the Maya underworld, where humans go when they die. Many locals still adhere to the myths and rituals their ancestors believed in. Today, they are the Yucatan region's only natural source of freshwater. Tourists, both national and international, enjoy the cenotes in their own ways. Their configurations make them ideal swimming holes and a welcome escape from the region's intense heat. Some are even equipped with ziplines, tanning decks, diving platforms and snack bars. One group of visitors, freedivers, are especially drawn to the cenotes. These sinkholes are a freediving paradise since each one has a unique configuration and is isolated from the effects of currents, waves and wind. Since freedivers use minimal gear and aren't bound to the rules of scuba diving (time limits, safety stops, coming up slowly to the surface), they can meander through the water, weave through obstacles and be approached by marine creatures. These one-of-a-kind experiences and places are inspirational not only to the divers themselves, but to viewers who see the photos and videos they produce. Cenotes are under threat from land mismanagement, over-development and mishandling of sewage and waste. Since the sinkholes are interconnected, it might only be a matter of time before they are all destroyed or polluted. Fortunately, there's a growing number of ecologically conscious businesses, tourists and activists doing their part to protect Mexico's sacred cenotes. Freedivers in particular are showcasing their magnificence through visual media, creating a strong and vocal community  and even becoming ambassadors and advocates for their protection. The Yucatan Peninsula is almost completely composed of porous limestone  picture a hard and holey piece of Swiss cheese made of calcareous rock. More than 65 million years ago, it was completely submerged under the sea as part of a coral reef system. The Chicxulub asteroid impact shifted the underlying tectonic plates and lifted the reef out of the water. Over millions of years, rain and seawater carved its way through the bedrock to create aquifers just metres below the ground. When the ground collapses and creates a sinkhole, as it does quite often in the Yucatan Peninsula, it sometimes exposes these aquifers in the form of natural pools, or cenotes (from the Mayan word ts'ono'ot, which means ""hole filled with water""). The region's unprecedented and singular history gained it Unesco World Heritage tentative listing in 2012. nan To enter a cenote is to enter the underworld: Xibalba. According to Maya belief, one must first ask permission and perform rituals to safely enter. Offerings must be made, and many years ago these took the form of gold, jade, copper and or even live humans. These offerings were made to appease gods such as Chaac, the rain god who the Maya believe dwells within cenotes. These days, offerings consist mainly of copal (tree resin), cacao, seeds, corn, flower petals, sugar and other small objects. Tourists can book cultural tours to watch rituals and performances at various cenotes  without fear of being sacrificed, of course. Most travellers who visit cenotes will spend the day exploring the caves and going for a swim. Putting on a mask or goggles will allow you to see a variety of small fish, turtles, crocodiles and interesting rock formations just below the surface. But this is just the tip of the iceberg. The deeper you go, the more you see. When freediving, you hold your breath and dive down to a specified depth without the use of an air source. It requires deep concentration as well as awareness of oneself and the environment, and allows you to immerse yourself completely in a cenote in the least disruptive way possible. You'll find stalagmites and stalactites that date back millions of years, jumbles of fallen trees and debris, fossils of extinct animals, underwater creatures that exist nowhere else on Earth and countless other fascinating features. Travellers can book freediving sessions with the many schools and outfitters in the region. Sunlight filters in through holes in the roofs of cenotes and focuses them into distinct beams, a natural phenomenon found in very few other places. Seeing these light beams inspires an otherworldly sense of awe and wonder. They also make for unique photo opportunities, a trend that is on the rise as more and more people explore the vast underwater landscape of Mexico's cenotes. Many species depend upon cenotes as a place to relax and replenish. Isolated from the open ocean, these sinkholes provide a sanctuary from harsh weather conditions, waves, large predators and boat traffic. Manatees make their way into cenotes via caves that are connected to the Caribbean Sea. Here, the endangered species can rest, fill up on algae and even nurse their young in a safe and peaceful environment. The interactions between freedivers and marine life in the cenotes are one-of-a-kind experiences. Crocodiles are a vital part of the region's biodiversity. They can be found in many cenotes, even the ones that tourists frequent. It is important to respect the animals' space, so keeping a safe distance and not provoking them is of utmost importance. Sometimes, however, their curiosity gets the better of them and they'll come to have a peek at what the peculiar humans are doing. In some cenotes, you'll find a layer of hydrogen sulphide that separates freshwater from cumulative rainfall from salty ocean water, essentially forming an underwater cloud. Swimming around and into these clouds gives the distinct impression of cruising through space and weaving through nebulae. More like this:  The buried secrets of the deadliest location on Earth  The Train Maya: Mexico's ambitious new tourism megaproject  Mexico's controversial new 'superhighway' The layers are formed by gases released by decomposing matter such as trees and leaves that fall into the sinkholes. Some clouds are formed near the surface at a depth of a just few metres, while others can be found up to 30m deep. These thick, nebulous layers smell slightly of rotten eggs and are known to lightly sting your lips if you stay in them too long. The cloud pictured above is at a depth of about 28m and below it lies another 28m of saltwater. People of all ages and backgrounds travel to explore Mexico's magnificent cenotes. The water temperature ranges from 19-24C, making them a welcome respite from the tropical heat. Many cenote owners have invested in infrastructure such as platforms, toilets and eateries, as well as offering guided tours and performances. With thousands of different cenotes to choose from, you will never run out of new locations to explore. nan Living in harmony with ourselves and our surroundings is something many of us strive to achieve. Freediving requires a tremendous amount of understanding of both the mind and the world around us so it's no wonder that freedivers are passionate about these delicate ecosystems. Cenotes provide an unparalleled realm in which to go deeper, both physically and mentally, in a natural and peaceful setting. To preserve these special places, it is essential that they are protected from contamination and over development. Some freedivers are stepping in and standing up against major forces, such as the Maya Train system, that are doing immense damage to the interconnected system of thousands of cenotes. Tourists can also help reduce any harm done to cenotes by choosing sustainable eco-tourism operators and refraining from wearing harmful sunblock and hair products.

The inland harbour of the real ships of the Fens,"The ship's captain reported ""grounding"" in the River Nene en route to Wisbech at about 08:49 BST on Tuesday. The 80m (262ft) cargo vessel was sailing from Riga, Latvia, with a cargo of timber. It was freed at 21:52 on Tuesday and sailed into Wisbech at 22:30 with no injuries reported. Local historians estimate ships sail about 12 miles (19km) down the tidal Nene, which has been cut at various points over the years to make navigation easier, before reaching the Port of Wisbech. Cargo vessels normally have pilots on board to guide them down the river. Fenland District Council, which has its head offices in March, Cambridgeshire, about 25 miles (40km) from The Wash coast, is the statutory harbour authority. ""Located on the River Nene, Wisbech Port and Yacht Harbour is Cambridgeshire's only gateway to the sea,"" the council explains on its website. ""It offers a wide variety of marine services as well as leisure mooring facilities."" The council describes Wisbech as a ""busy commercial shipping port"" and says vessels up to 83m (272ft) and 13m (43ft)  wide are ""welcome"". Robert Bell, curator of the Wisbech & Fenland Museum, said there was probably a port at Wisbech in Norman times, nearly 1,000 years ago. Ely Museum's website explains how the Fens were traditionally flat wetlands with islands of higher land. For that reason, Ely is sometimes known as The Isle of Ely. Drainage began about 400 years ago and continued for hundreds of years. Fenland council says Wisbech has ""served as a port since medieval times"". ""After the estuary of the River Ouse became silted up, it was diverted into the sea at Lynn,"" its website explains. ""This led to the construction of the present course of the River Nene from Peterborough to The Wash."" Fenland said drained marshes provided rich farmland and brought prosperity to Wisbech and its port. ""It was the centre of a thriving agricultural region and an important trading centre - with shipments of corn and oilseed rape to the coast and continent, and imports which included coal from the north and timber from the Baltic,"" adds the council website. ""All this prosperity led to the magnificent Georgian architecture of the buildings along the Brinks, with North and South Brink deemed two of the finest Georgian streets in England."" A  company called Port of Wisbech Ltd has held a ""stevedoring"" licence from the district council, which owns the quayside, for 20 years. The company owns and operates two ships - Baltic Express and Baltic Arrow which carry wood and other cargo from Riga, Latvia, on the Baltic Sea, to Wisbech. Earlier this year, the company said it had started handling shipments of a lightweight ""expanded clay aggregate"". Crossings from Riga to Wisbech typically take five days, the company website explains. Other vessels have also got stuck in the Nene. A cargo ship called Lagik grounded at Sutton Bridge, Lincolnshire, on 13 December 2000. Lagik was carrying steel and became wedged. The ship, later declared a ""constructive total loss"", blocked the Nene and closed the Port of Wisbech for 44 days. Two fishery patrols vessels and a number of fishing and recreation craft were stranded in Wisbech. A salavage operation began in late December 2000 The last section of Lagik was removed from the river in late January 2001. Follow Cambridgeshire news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

That is the nickname of the 11th Century Ely Cathedral, which dominates its flat Cambridgeshire surrounds like a ship on the horizon. But people were reminded this week that actual ships really do sail through the fenlands of Norfolk and Cambridgeshire when a cargo vessel got wedged in a river. Cargo ships have been sailing into The Wash and then down the River Nene to the inland Port of Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, for centuries - and the Baltic Arrow was not the first to come a cropper.

Theatre left empty for 30 years to be auctioned,"Built in 1899, the theatre became a bingo hall in 1963, before shutting for good three decades later. A long-running campaign to bring the property back into use as a performance venue commissioned a feasibility study in 2021. But this found that urgent repair works would be needed before it could be re-opened, even with a greatly reduced audience capacity. In April, campaigners marked its 125th anniversary by calling for it to be brought back into use. Mr Vandenbrook, associate director at auctioneer Mark Jenkinson, said the community in Doncaster had been ""saddened"" by its gradual decline. He said: ""It has been unused for almost 30 years and putting the property up for sale at auction with nil reserve will no doubt be the catalyst for a positive new future for this much-loved Victorian icon, which definitely has the potential to become an asset to the city centre economy once again."" He added: ""While it would be tremendous to see it return to use as an arts venue, in recent years other period properties within the city centre, such as the Wool Market, have undergone sympathetic redevelopment that has given them a new identity, attracting more people into the city centre and serving as prime examples of successful regeneration projects.""

Theatre's 1894 panto poster on display for milestone,"The building, now ""one of the finest examples of Victorian architecture in the city"", first staged an opera for two nights, Utopia Ltd by D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, before closing for panto rehearsals. One of the great British music hall figures of the Edwardian era, Queenie Leighton, ""a much-loved star of the West End pantomimes"", played the title role, the theatre said. The poster and programme can be seen on the dress circle level of the theatre at the top of the staircase that leads from the foyer. Mr Mitchell said the items, as well as ""a great many unpublished works of art"" and photographs, had been kept by his relative George Bradney Mitchell. His great, great, grandfather had intended to publish a book in colour entitled Wolverhampton and its Environs ""to inform future generations of the changes for the better"" to the city in the late 19th Century. But ""despite his experimentations in print, the colour printing process had not yet been commercially successful"", Mr Mitchell explained. He added he himself had now been ""privileged enough to continue his wishes"" by publishing information online. The theatre will officially celebrate its 130th anniversary on 10 December this year to coincide with its original opening. More memorabilia from pantomimes such as Mother Goose starring Ian McKellen and John Bishop and the theatre's 2023/24 production of Snow White will also feature as part of the celebrations in the near future.

Think carefully before swimming in heatwave - LFB,"Craig Carter, LFB's assistant commissioner for prevention and protection, said: While it might be tempting to go into water to cool off from the heat, were asking people to think carefully. Despite the warm weather, Londons waterways are still cold enough to put a person into cold water shock which can affect anybody, no matter their fitness."" About 60% of accidental drownings occur in the UK's inland waterways, such as rivers, canals, lakes and reservoirs, according to data from the National Water Safety Forum (NWSF). The LFB has also issued a warning around the fire risks posed by barbeques as the mercury climbs. We know many Londoners will want to enjoy the nice weather by visiting a park or open space,"" Mr Carter said. ""However, were asking people not to take disposable barbecues with them as they can cause grass fires, especially in hot weather when the ground is dry.""

Thousands mark 80th D-Day anniversary at air show,"The D-Day landings, also known as Operation Overlord, was one of the most decisive military campaigns of World War Two. It saw 156,000 Allied troops arrive in Normandy on 6 June 1944 for a combined naval, air and land assault on Nazi-occupied France. At this point, Duxford airfield was the headquarters of the 78th Fighter Group of the United States Army Air Forces' 8th Air Force, flying fighter aircraft such as P-47 Thunderbolts and P-51 Mustangs. ""Only a very few of the objectives for D-Day were reached at the end of 6 June, but it was enough for the Allies to get a foothold into Europe to then go further,"" said historical re-enactor Mark Bailey. He runs an educational project called Discover D-Day, based in Attleborough, Norfolk, which is ""mainly about the American Airborne and Army in the last year of the Second World War"". ""We cover a very wide range of things,"" he said. ""We cover a lot of things to do with engineers, we talk about explosives, the way weapons were developed during the war. ""We also talk about poeple who were forgotten, so the people who would do all the clerical work, paying of the troops making sure they had the right equipment in the right place at the right time.""

Thousands raised by fridge trek up mountain,"Three men have raised thousands of pounds for charity by taking turns carrying a fridge from a town to the summit of Yr Wyddfa, also known as Snowdon. Rowan Ingram and Richard Carpenter, who work at Wicked Van Hire in Ludlow, Shropshire, complete yearly challenges with the company for good causes and were joined on the feat by their friend Cameron Nicholas. The trio raised more than £3,400 for the Teenage Cancer Trust which they said they chose due to a family-friend connection. ""We're astounded by people's generosity,"" said Mr Ingram. The men strapped the fridge, which they nicknamed Becky, to their backs with a rucksack and took turns to carry it over the more than 60 miles (96.5km). ""The idea to go to Snowdon from Ludlow was always floated and then we had a [building] clearance where the fridge was just there in our yard, and we thought 'why not take the fridge?'"" Mr Ingram told BBC Radio Shropshire. The team averaged about 15 miles (24km) per day. ""By about day five and six we were really starting to feel it. We went through a good few packs of blister plasters,"" he added. ""It was quite scary to do Snowdon after six days of walking but actually it was the easiest day, we flew up,"" he said. ""A lot of people called us crazy. On day one when we were walking through Craven Arms and Bishops Castle, people were in disbelief."" They reached the summit on Saturday and went straight back to work in the following days. ""We had a fridge yesterday, I couldn't quite look at it the same,"" said Mr Ingram. They were already planning ideas for next year's fundraiser and he said there were suggestions being thrown around to try to break a world record. ""I think we're done with appliances now,"" he added. Follow BBC Shropshire on Facebook, X and Instagram. Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk"

Tories pledge focus on pubs and clubs in 'first 100 days',"Earlier this year, Pryzm and Atik nightclubs owner Rekom announced the closure of 17 venues with the loss of 500 jobs, with bosses saying students were cutting back on midweek nights out because of cost-of-living pressures. About 400 nightclubs shut down permanently between March 2020 and December 2023, according to the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA). A review of England's night-time economy had been promised in the Conservative manifesto, but the party has now said it would begin within the first 100 days if it wins the general election. The Tories said they would cut what they described as red tape ""unnecessarily holding back growth and adding operating costs for businesses"", and consider creating a ministerial position for the sector. They would ""protect"" music venues, they added, by strengthening the enforcement of the ""agent of change"" planning principle, which requires developers who build near an existing venue to pay for their own sound proofing. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), said the body had seen a ""considerable amount of broad brush commitments"" in manifestos from all political parties, and was ""frustrated by the lack of detail and substance"". He said it was ""encouraging to see that the Conservatives have listened to our recent call for more detail"", but warned the night-time industry, which employs more than two million people, ""needs these commitments and more"". Without doubt we need the new government to re-evaluate our licensing and planning systems, removing red tape and unnecessary regulatory burdens, and moving towards a system that is proportionate, fair, and consistent,"" he added.

Nightclubs, venues and music festivals have shut in their droves, and thousands of pub landlords have pulled their last pint."" A spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats said the pledge was an ""empty promise"". ""The sheer number of closed shops, pubs and restaurants in high streets across the UK is a testament to the Conservatives' utter failure to support Britain's local economies,"" they added. The SNP's economy spokesperson also suggested the review would be ""too little too late"". They added that it is calling for a cut in the rate of VAT for the tourism and hospitality sector ""which would make a real difference to businesses and help grow the economy""."
Torrential rains trigger deadly landslides in Ecuador,"Some 30 people who had been reported missing after the landslide have been found alive, officials said. Heavy machinery has been sent to the area to clear roads which have been blocked by rocks and mud. Local media reported that of the six people confirmed to have died, five were members of the same family. Residents of Baños have been urged to stock up on bottled water as risk management officials warned that the supply of tap water could be affected by the severe rains. The city's mayor also asked locals to stay at home in order to minimise traffic on affected roads. Schools will remain closed on Monday in Baños and classes will be held online. A shelter has been opened for those whose homes have been damaged. Meteorologists said the heavy rains were caused by an area of low pressure which moved over Ecuador on Sunday. The heavy rains come just months after the South American country experienced a drought. The area of low pressure has since moved north. El Salvador, in Central America, has warned of possible flooding and landslides. nan"

Town disruption as crash causes 'extensive damage',"Following the crash, Seth's bar had to close for the evening. Barmaid Charlotte Winfindale said: ""Wednesday is usually a busy day, as we have a pizza deal, so it was a bit of an inconvenience for the business."" She added their building suffered no damage and they were due to reopen on Thursday afternoon. The Coffee Kitchen, a bakery a few doors down, was also evacuated due to fears of a gas leak following the incident. Owner Andy Walsh said they were back inside the building within an hour, but it was not the first time vehicles had hit that corner. ""I feel for the people whose building it is,"" he said. He was not expecting his business to be affected too much by the road closure, as he has regulars going to buy bread and other goods from the shop each morning, however he was concerned for those relying more heavily on passing traffic. One such business is Dachsund Vintage Interiors Homeware, which was already seeing an impact from temporary traffic lights on nearby Cocker Bridge. Owner Susan Seekings said she wanted people to know that Market Place businesses were very much open for business. ""I feel a bit frustrated, it just seems to be one thing after another,"" she said. ""Footfall isn't great at this end of town anyway, so it can really affect small businesses, so we just want to remind people we are here and we are open."" She added she believed more restrictions and signs to warn large vehicles should be placed at the Kirkgate junction to avoid future issues. Cumberland Council said it did not know when it would be in a position to reopen the road. Elaine Denham, who works at Alana's Laundry Basket, said she had been contacted by customers to ask whether they would be able to reach the shop and she was concerned about the long-term impact it could have on Market Place. ""Market Place can be quiet anyway, not a lot of people will come up to Market Place - they forget about it."" Follow BBC Cumbria on X (formerly Twitter), Facebook and Instagram.

Town marks opening of first cemetery since 1898,"A town has seen the unveiling of its first new cemetery in more than 125 years . Peel House Cemetery, in Widnes, was opened by the deputy mayor of Halton, Councillor Martha Lloyd Jones. Built on a 12-acre site, which was formerly part of Fairfield High School's playing fields, it is the first newly-built cemetery in the town since Birchfield Road Cemetery opened in 1898. Construction of Peel House was completed in April 2020, at a cost of £1.3m. It has provision for an estimated 50 years for full burials and cremated-remains burials, as well as cremated-remains sanctum vaults. nan The opening of Peel House marks the culmination of a long process which began when a working group was set up by the council in 2011 to find a new site, after it was revealed the Birchfield Road Cemetery was running out of space. The deputy mayor told the Local Democracy Reporting Service: The creation of a new cemetery is not an everyday occurrence  it signifies a very important moment in time, for an authority and for the community. It demonstrates the importance of providing a fitting place to remember people that we have lost, and shows the care and attention we place in doing this. The site includes a columbarium garden, described as a ""quiet, contemplative space"" affording above-ground granite vaults in which cremated remains are housed. At the centre of the site is another garden, with covered seating facing a central Pennine stone monolith. The southern half of the site is currently maintained as a meadow seeded with wild flowers, and the perimeter is planted with a native mix of hedgerow and woodland trees. nan Listen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

Town's cash machines 'running out of money',"""When Barclays went, it took the cashpoint it had with it,"" she said. There are two other cash points in the town, she said, but they have struggled to cope with the demand. ""We are a cash-only business here, so we have had to turn customers away. A few other businesses here have had to do the same."" A few doors down from Hot Gossip, Nicola Lund helps her father run Top Cards, a greetings card shop, where the cash machine shortage is also having an impact. She said: ""The Post Office is quite a way in to town as well, so older people have to walk down there to get cash out, and they don't want to walk back - I don't blame them,"" she said, adding a nearby phone shop said its footfall had decreased since the bank closed. ""I am worried about the future of the business because of this."" In a statement Barclays said consumer behaviour had changed, with the majority now choosing online banking, which was reflected in the Treorchy branch. It said it had provided a mobile van two days a week since the branch closed. Treorchy is not alone in losing its banks, with Mountain Ash facing a similar situation half an hour away. The town has been without a bank since the last branch, Lloyds, closed in 2017. A ""banking hub"" is expected to open in the town next year, which will allow customers of any bank to withdraw and deposit cash, as well as make payments. The service will join seven others across Wales  two of which are currently open, in Welshpool, Powys, and Prestatyn, Denbighshire. Further locations are cited for Abergele in Conwy county, Abertillery in Blaenau Gwent, Morriston in Swansea, Porthcawl in Bridgend county and Risca in Caerphilly county. In Treorchy, a temporary hub has been opened on the site of the former Barclays on Bute Street. Like others in Wales it is run by Cash Access UK - operating Monday to Friday between 09:00 and 17:00  which said it was looking for a permanent home for the hub. Research by the consumer organisation Which? suggested by the end of 2025, Wales will have lost two-thirds of the bank branches that were open in 2015, leaving only 188 left in the country. The Welsh Affairs Committee has launched an inquiry into the issue, finding the number of bank and building society branches in Wales fell from 695 in 2012, to 435 in 2022, and 22 high street bank branch closures had already been announced for 2024. Adrian Buckle, head of research for the trade association UK Finance, said there had been an increased trend of banks reviewing the costs of operating branches. ""If you go back 15 years, six out of 10 payments that we made were made using cash - but, as of last year, this had fallen to about 14% of payments,"" he said. Mr Buckle said although he does not expect bank branches to become a thing of the past, the way banks operated on the high street may change, including the likely prevalence of banking hubs. ""Its no longer financially viable to have five or six separate banks that have their own branches. But they can now share a branch, and provide that face-to-face banking service to customers in the area who want to bank that way. ""I do think it's something that we'll see the entire industry taking more advantage of, and that will be something that will be good for consumers,"" he said. Disappearing bank branches and cash machines running out of money are leaving people concerned over the future of their high street. The last bank branch in Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, closed in April, leaving the remaining cash machines in the town struggling to cope with demand. More than 20 bank branches have closed in Wales so far in 2024, with two thirds of branches expected to go between 2015 and 2025, partly due to online banking. Sara Bailey, who runs Hot Gossip coffee shop in Treorchy, said her business and others had suffered since Barclays closed its doors, with remaining cash points in the town running out of money ""once, even twice a day on some days"". ""When Barclays went, it took the cashpoint it had with it,"" she said. There are two other cash points in the town, she said, but they have struggled to cope with the demand.

Tractor chase: Teenager arrested after pursuit near Dorchester,"A yellow JCB Fastrac tractor with a trailer was reported stolen from the Martinstown area at about 23:40 BST on Sunday, Dorset Police said. A helicopter was involved in the pursuit of the agricultural vehicle, which has a top speed of about 44mph. The vehicle was stopped about eight hours later after reportedly failing to do so on several occasions. Supt Gavin House, of Dorset Police, said: ""Officers responded swiftly and worked overnight to ensure any reported risks to other road users were minimised and the incident was brought to a safe conclusion."" After being taken from Martinstown, the tractor was seen driving on the A37 north of Dorchester, before travelling on several rural roads in the Dorchester and Piddle Valley area. Supt House said the tractor was stopped in the area of Bradford Peverell at about 07:45 on Monday. He appealed for any witnesses ""to the manner of driving of this tractor"" and anyone with dashcam footage, to contact the force. Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Tractor rule change sparks row on car-free island,"The proposition to change the law has been submitted by members of the Douzaine, the body which looks after roads on the island, to be considered by the Chief Pleas in early July. At the moment, tractors are the only motor vehicles which may be driven on the island - but their use is restricted to six days of the week. Some people, however, have special permission to drive their tractor seven days a week. Members of Sark's government have asked for the law to be changed so all tractors may be driven at any time. In the proposition submitted by Conseiller Chris Bateson, chairman of the Douzaine, he wrote that ""there has been a gradual shift from the notion of 'keeping Sunday special' to it becoming 'just another working day'"". His opinion was echoed by Bernadette Southern, chef at restaurant Fleur du Jardin, who said: ""It's totally different to what it was years ago, when Sunday was a relaxing day."" She also said the summer season was now so short it was ""essential"" farmers and other people who needed tractors should be able to use them seven days a week. She said: ""The boats change through the winter, so there aren't the same number of tourists. Everybody needs to make their money through the summertime. ""Times really do need to change. I think everything else is changing so this needs to change too."" However, Jason Salisbury, of Sark Dairy, said he believed the law should remain as it was, saying it was a selling point for tourists that the island was traffic-free, and that keeping one day a week with minimal tractor movement would ""keep Sark special"". He said he did not want to work on Sundays despite working in agriculture. He said: ""If you can't organise yourself not to try during a particular time, then you need to sort it out."" As a compromise, Mr Salisbury suggested restricting tractors between 10:00 and 15:00, except for emergency services. Peter Plummer, nicknamed the King of Sark, drives the tractor-towed bus service, known locally as the ""toast rack"" because of the shape of its passenger-carrying trailer, taking visitors up and down Harbour Hill on arrival and when leaving the island. He holds special permission to drive his vehicle seven days a week and said he did not think the rule should be changed to allow everyone to do the same. ""If the rule is changed, I think people will take it for granted. ""It's a slippery slope - at what point do you say no?"" He said that, despite dwindling summer seasons, allowing more tractor movement, and with it more dust and noise, would hurt the tourist economy rather than help it. The proposition will be considered at the midsummer Chief Pleas on 3 July. The report was originally on the agenda of the easter meeting of Chief Pleas but, owing to a vote of no confidence in the Douzaine, it was withdrawn. The Douzaine discussed the report and decided to resubmit it and allow Chief Pleas to decide on the matter. Conseiller Chris Bateson said: ""The Douzaine is aware that the subject of Sunday tractors is a contentious matter and hopes that Sark residents make their feelings known to both the committee and conseillers in general."""
Train company plans to replace old rolling stock,"The rail firm says that Alstom, CAF, Hitachi, Siemens and Stadler have been shortlisted to provide the new trains. Steve White, managing director of Southeastern, said: As part of our commitment to building a better, more reliable and sustainable railway we are pushing forward with our plans to develop our Metro operation into a high-performing railway. We are working at pace, with our partners at Network Rail, to improve performance, expand our timetable, enhance our stations and increase staffing levels.

Train delayed due to 'co-moo-ter' cows on line,"A train was delayed during the morning rush hour when cattle managed to get onto a railway line. The Transpennine Express service between York and Manchester Piccadilly was halted by the bovine trespassers, who gained access to the tracks between Huddersfield and Dewsbury on Wednesday. The two cows refused to move, leaving the 08:58 BST departure stranded near Mirfield. Commuters had to wait 30 minutes for the animals to be removed, and Transpennine cancelled all of the train's scheduled station stops between Huddersfield and Manchester. The cows were eventually moved by the farmer and Network Rail staff. A Network Rail spokesperson said: ""At 9:45 BST on Wednesday, we received reports of cows on the line near Mirfield resulting in delays to some train services. Unsure whether they were co-moo-ting or travelling for leisure, they were certainly milking it. ""Our teams headed out to site and, with assistance from the farmer, the cows were re-moo-ved safely from the railway. The line was re-opened at 10:57 BST and we would like to thank passengers for their patience while the incident was ongoing."" Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

Transport hub plan to support steelmaking approved,"Mr Musgrave said securing the planning permission for the hub would allow the industrial site to meet the needs of British Steel and other companies who were expected to move onto the site. The transport hub will primarily be used by heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) and will contain about 150 parking spaces for them, along with more than 200 car parking spaces. There will also be an amenity block containing shower and toilet facilities, a hydrogen refuelling station, gatehouses and bus stops. A report for members of Redcar and Cleveland Councils regulatory committee said detailed layouts and designs were not yet available for all the elements of the transport hub. The impacts of any structures built would be considered at the reserved matters approval stage, it said. Councillor Malcolm Head said he hoped the creation of the hub would reduce the need for HGVs to park in nearby lay-bys, which he said was ""not very safe"". Councillor Stuart Smith added the land the transport hub would be built on was currently derelict. ""It will regenerate the area and provide jobs,"" he added.

Trump calls Biden a âbad Palestinianâ in US presidential debate jab,"Republican Donald Trump has called US President Joe Biden âa very bad Palestinianâ who doesnât want to help Israel âfinish the jobâ against Hamas in its war on Gaza. âHe doesnât want to do it. Heâs become like a Palestinian â but they donât like him because heâs a very bad Palestinian, heâs a weak one,â former president Trump said in the first presidential debate with Biden on Thursday in Atlanta, Georgia. Ayah Ziyadeh, director of American Muslims for Palestine, told Al Jazeera that the âbad Palestinianâ comment âwas very blatantly racistâ. âUsing Palestinian as a slur shows the depths of racism that exists here,â Ziyadeh said. While foreign policy and the Middle East were referenced numerous times during the debate, as pro-Palestinian protests were held near the venue, the suffering of Palestinians and the toll of Israelâs campaign in Gaza â which has killed more than 37,700 people since October â received little mention. Neither Biden, who is under pressure from his Democratic base over his staunch support of ally Israel, nor Trump is âfit to representâ Palestinian and Arab communities in the United States, Ziyadeh said. âNot only are Muslim and Arab Americans deciding that they donât want to commit to Biden or re-elect him because of his continued stance and fuelling of Israelâs genocide in Gaza. But the broader American public has also shifted and itâs become one of the biggest issues that is impacting the coming elections,â she said. nan nan The debate highlighted how both Democrats and Republicans have lost their will to end the war and to support the creation of a Palestinian state, said Tamer Qarmout, a professor at the Doha Institute of Graduate Studies. âThe focus of the discussion was not on a Palestinian state per se â it was one supporting Israel and the best way to support Israel,â he told Al Jazeera. âFor both candidates, thereâs a lack of real vision to end this conflict. Itâs a very shallow discussion that does not have ending the conflict in the centre of it.â Trump said Israel wanted the war to continue, and that it should. Asked whether he would support the establishment of a Palestinian state to secure peace in the region, Trump baulked. âIâd have to see.â One candidate is âblatantly racist. Wants to deport all of us. And said that President Biden isnât, essentially, being genocidal enough and that he should let Israel finish off its war on Gaza. And the current president has been consciously and willingly, politically and financially, backing an evident genocide in Gaza,â Ziyadeh told Al Jazeera. âThere is no lesser than two evils here,â she added. âThe card we are being dealt with as voters and as Americans is frankly unfair.â Meanwhile, Biden falsely claimed that every party but Hamas had agreed to his ceasefire proposal and that he had secured an across-the-board agreement for his three-stage plan to end the war, including from Israel. âEveryone from the United Nations Security Council, straight through the G7 to the Israelis and [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu have endorsed the plan that I put forward,â Biden said. âThe only one who wants the war to continue is Hamas.â He reiterated his opinion that Hamas has been âgreatly weakenedâ by Israel, adding that the group âshould be eliminatedâ. Biden also noted that he was the first recent president to not have soldiers at risk overseas. Meanwhile, Trump described Bidenâs withdrawal from Afghanistan as the âmost embarrassing moment in the history of our countryâ and said it encouraged Russia to invade Ukraine. nan nan"
Trust and homelessness are key themes for voters,"Andrew Talbot, who runs local homeless charity We Are Humans, said: ""We've got people sleeping rough on our streets, under our piers in tents and on park benches, ex-military veterans sleeping in shop doorways. ""What's going to get my vote is, what are you doing about homelessness? What are you doing about building houses for families, communities?"" Tony Spotswood, former chief executive of Royal Bournemouth Hospital, said: ""I think the big issues are around, firstly, cost of living and affordability for young people, for families and older people.

Two gunmen jailed for home shooting,"A spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service said no one was injured, but the shooting left the victim ""terrified"". CCTV footage captured Roscoe and Connor fleeing from the scene before getting into a car and driving along Hessle Road, police said. The vehicle was registered to Connor, who had driven from Liverpool via Skelmersdale, where he stopped at a pub and picked up Roscoe. CCTV footage showed the men parking the car just before 15:45 BST, before walking past the property to scope it out. About an hour later, police were called to reports of gunshots. Officers found a bullet hole through the front window. Det Ch Insp Jayne Goodens said: Clearly these men thought they could evade the police by shooting at a property... before fleeing back to Merseyside and Lancashire, but sadly for them this wasnt the case."" She said the force worked with the relevant constabularies to ""take two violent men off our streets where they can no longer cause harm to our communities"". There is no doubt that this was an extremely dangerous act, which could have very easily resulted in someone being seriously injured or killed,"" the detective said. Connor was found on Crosswood Crescent, in Liverpool, where he was arrested on 3 August. Three weeks later, Roscoe was arrested at Liverpool Airport, where he was found using another persons details to travel. Follow BBC East Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

Two seriously injured as car crashes into bar,"David Court was at the bar when the crash happened, he had been doing some maintenance and was taking his tools back to his van. He said: ""The car just came out of nowhere, I couldn't tell you what sort of speed it was doing but it just mounted the curb and run into the outside area of the bar."" He added that he believes metal bars in the outside seating area helped to slow the vehicle down. An air ambulance was also at the scene however Mr Court said he did not see anyone get into the helicopter. He praised the fast response of the emergency services and the community spirit of neighbouring local businesses who have offered tables and chairs to the bar so that it has been able to reopen to customers.

UK economy grew more than estimated in early 2024,"Paul Dales, chief UK economist at research company Capital Economics, said the faster growth rise in GDP in early 2024 was ""mainly due to upward revisions to consumer spending"". The ONS said there was increased spending on recreation and culture, as well as housing and food, but added household disposable incomes had continued to rise in early 2024 as workers secured wage increases. Mr Dales said this meant household saving rates rose from 10.2% at the end of last year to 11.1%, which was the highest rate since mid 2021 when savings were boosted during the Covid pandemic. He added the new figure suggested ""whoever is Prime Minister this time next week may benefit from the economic recovery being a bit stronger"". ""Its the tiniest sliver of improvement but when it comes to UK GDP growth, every little really does help,"" said Danni Hewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis. ""Growth has been front and centre of party manifestos, even if they differ on the details of how that growth can be achieved. A growing economy creates wealth, puts more money in peoples pockets and ups the amount of tax delivered to the Treasurys depleted coffers."" While the UK has emerged from the economic recession it entered in the final months of 2023, many households may not be feeling better off, with budgets having been stretched by rising prices in recent times. Interest rates are currently at their highest for 16 years at 5.25%, meaning people are paying more to borrow money for things such as mortgages and loans, although savers have also received better returns. The latest figures on the economy show it failed to grow in April after particularly wet weather put off shoppers and slowed down construction. The Bank of England, which sets interest rates, has opened the door to cutting them in August in what would be the first drop in borrowing costs for more than four years. But many mortgage holders have already refinanced at higher costs, and about three million more households set to see their repayments rise in the next two years as fixed-rate deals come to an end. Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said while ""hotter-than-expected growth doesnt help those looking for a faster route to cutting interest rates, it does help to boost overall optimism"". ""The deep-seated productivity problems in the UK are overall a bigger concern than the immediate interest rate outlook,"" she added. The economy grew by more than initially estimated in the first three months of 2024 as the UK emerged from recession, revised official figures show. Between January and March, the economy grew by 0.7% the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Figures released last month initially estimated growth had been 0.6%. The strength of the economy has been a central battleground in the general election campaign, with growth having been sluggish in recent years. Most economists, politicians and businesses want to see GDP rising steadily, because it usually means people are spending more, extra jobs are created, more tax is paid to the government and workers get better pay rises. The original figure for the first quarter of the year was stronger than economists had expected, and growth in the services sector, which includes businesses such as hairdressers, banks, and hospitality, helped to push it higher, the ONS said. But while services growth was revised upwards, increases in manufacturing were revised down on the back of more data being collected. Due to the upward revision, the UK was the fastest growing economy in the G7 group of countries with advanced economies in the first three months of this year. Prime Minister and Conservative leader Rishi Sunak hailed the new revised growth and said his party had a ""clear plan to deliver a more secure future for your family"". But Labour accused the Conservatives of ""14 years economic vandalism"", which it said had left people worse off. ""A Labour government will grow the economy and show Britain is open for business with a plan for growth, so that we can put money back in peoples pockets,"" said a spokesperson. Sarah Olney, Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, said despite the upward revision, the figures would ""come as cold comfort for families being hammered by spiralling mortgage repayments, unfair stealth taxes and the cost of a weekly food shop going through the roof"". Paul Dales, chief UK economist at research company Capital Economics, said the faster growth rise in GDP in early 2024 was ""mainly due to upward revisions to consumer spending"". The ONS said there was increased spending on recreation and culture, as well as housing and food, but added household disposable incomes had continued to rise in early 2024 as workers secured wage increases. Mr Dales said this meant household saving rates rose from 10.2% at the end of last year to 11.1%, which was the highest rate since mid 2021 when savings were boosted during the Covid pandemic. He added the new figure suggested ""whoever is Prime Minister this time next week may benefit from the economic recovery being a bit stronger"". ""Its the tiniest sliver of improvement but when it comes to UK GDP growth, every little really does help,"" said Danni Hewson, AJ Bell head of financial analysis. ""Growth has been front and centre of party manifestos, even if they differ on the details of how that growth can be achieved. A growing economy creates wealth, puts more money in peoples pockets and ups the amount of tax delivered to the Treasurys depleted coffers."" While the UK has emerged from the economic recession it entered in the final months of 2023, many households may not be feeling better off, with budgets having been stretched by rising prices in recent times. Interest rates are currently at their highest for 16 years at 5.25%, meaning people are paying more to borrow money for things such as mortgages and loans, although savers have also received better returns. The latest figures on the economy show it failed to grow in April after particularly wet weather put off shoppers and slowed down construction. The Bank of England, which sets interest rates, has opened the door to cutting them in August in what would be the first drop in borrowing costs for more than four years. But many mortgage holders have already refinanced at higher costs, and about three million more households set to see their repayments rise in the next two years as fixed-rate deals come to an end. Sophie Lund-Yates, lead equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said while ""hotter-than-expected growth doesnt help those looking for a faster route to cutting interest rates, it does help to boost overall optimism"". ""The deep-seated productivity problems in the UK are overall a bigger concern than the immediate interest rate outlook,"" she added."
UK passport: How much does it cost to get or renew and what is the 10-year rule?,"Air travel is booming again, with more people expected to fly this summer, despite notably higher fares. But UK holidaymakers travelling to the EU are being warned not to get caught out by the ""10-year rule"", which has stopped some passengers from flying. Some British holidaymakers have been turned away at the airport because their passports are not valid for EU travel. UK travellers used to be able to carry up to nine months left on an old passport over to a new one. This meant that a passport could be valid for more than 10 years. But the rules changed after Brexit, and the majority of EU countries no longer accept British passports that were issued more than 10 years before the date of travel.  This is known as the ""10-year rule"". To enter those countries now, your UK passport must: If your passport does not meet these requirements, you will be refused entry. The rules apply in all 27 EU countries, except Ireland, which has its own separate travel arrangements with the UK. They also apply to passengers traveling to Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein - which are part of the European Economic Area (EEA) - and Switzerland. It costs £88.50 to get, renew or replace your passport if you apply online, or £100 for a postal application. An online application for a child's passport costs £57.50, or £69 via post. It costs more if you apply from abroad, or if you require a passport urgently. Passports are free for people born on or before 2 September 1929. These fees apply to both new passport applications and renewals. You must renew your passport before you travel if either: How much time you need on your passport depends on where you are going. You can check entry requirements for individual countries on the UK government's website. You can renew online at HM Passport Office or by filling in a paper application from certain Post Offices. You'll need your old passport and any valid passports you hold from a different country. For online applications, you'll also need a digital photo that meets specific requirements. For paper applications, you need two identical printed photos. The rules are different if you are renewing a passport for a child, your passport has been lost, stolen or damaged, or you need to change your name or personal details. It should take up to three weeks to renew a passport in the UK, but it can take longer during periods of high demand, such as before school holidays. To get a passport issued urgently in the UK, you can book an appointment at your nearest passport office, subject to availability. It then takes up to a week to be issued. You can get more information on the Passport Office website or you can call the helpline on 0300 222 0000. The line is open 08:00 to 20:00, Monday to Friday, and 09:00 to 17:30 on Saturday, Sunday and UK bank holidays."
UK sees hottest day of the year so far,"Thousands of ticket holders have begun filtering into the Glastonbury festival site, which is set to benefit from a sunny week - temperatures hit 27C on Wednesday but are expected to cool down during the rest of the week. On Thursday, blustery showers are expected in the north-west, with spells of rain in the south-west turning brighter later. The south-east will stay dry and warm. BBC Weather said many places can expect largely dry conditions this weekend, albeit with lower temperatures. Other areas will experience outbreaks of rain and strong winds with gusts of up to 50mph in places. Friday will be windy and cooler in the north, with showers, while the south will be breezy with some clouds. Saturday across the UK will be cloudy with a chance of rain, although still mainly sunny in the south."
UK sees hottest day of year so far as heat health alerts in place for millions,"Monday started bringing in the highest temperatures of 2024 in some locations, as warm air surged northwards across the UK. According to BBC Weather, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland all recorded their highest temperatures of the year on Monday. The temperature hit 28.3C (82.9F) in Wisley, Surrey; 27.3C (81.1F) in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire; and 25.9C (78.6F) in Magilligan, County Londonderry. In Wales, the highest temperature on Monday was 24.8C (76.6F) in Hawarden, Flintshire. But it did not beat this year's record, set in May in Gogerddan with 25.1C. Wednesday is likely to be the hottest day this week in England and Wales, although it will probably be only slightly hotter than Tuesday, BBC Weather forecaster John Hutchinson said. In the South East of England, midweek temperatures of 28 or 29C are likely, with 30C possible in a few spots, he added. Highs of 25 or 26C are expected in parts of Wales. Scotland and Northern Ireland expected to see their warmest weather on Monday, before cloudier and cooler weather arrives from the west on Tuesday. Northern parts of the UK can expect a few showers on Tuesday and Wednesday while it stays dry further south, Mr Hutchinson added. Some areas might reach the Met Offices official heatwave criteria. The nights will also be warmer and more humid than we have been used to lately, with overnight lows in some places only dropping into the mid-teens Celsius. Hay fever sufferers may also notice that pollen levels will be very high for most of the UK for the next few days. The weather is expected to turn cooler and wetter as colder air moves in from the west during Thursday. Depending on the timing, it could be another hot day in the South East of England, but cooler weather will move in by Friday morning, Mr Hutchinson said. Some south-eastern areas may not see that much rain, if any, he added. The temperatures are not unusual compared to past years: Six of the last seven Junes have recorded a maximum over 32C somewhere in the UK, according to Mr Hutchinson. Run by the UKHSA and the Met Office, the weather health alert system was introduced in June 2023. The service covers England only. The weather alerts are available to those who've registered, and are sent by email. Heat health alerts are typically issued between 1 June and 30 September, and cold health alerts between 1 November and 30 March. The system issues alerts to members of the public, and sends guidance directly to NHS England, the government and other healthcare professionals during periods of adverse weather. Alerts are categorised according to severity and include: The system was designed to help reduce illness and deaths by improving communication between the public and relevant bodies during periods of extreme weather. Heat health alerts are different to Met Office weather warnings - categorised red, amber and yellow - which are issued in cases of extreme heat, as well as rain, wind, snow, ice, fog, thunderstorm and lightning. Yellow heat health alerts have been active since 08:00 on Monday 24 June in all but one region of England: The North East is not affected. The alerts will remain in place until 17:00 on Thursday 27 June. The weather is expected to turn cooler, cloudier and wetter by the end of the week, but the Met Office says there is uncertainty about how quickly that change will take place. Glastonbury Festival has got a reputation for attracting rainstorms, but will festival goers need to pack the wellies this year? Its been largely dry at Worthy Farm for several days, so the ground is looking reasonably firm and dry before the festival, which begins on Wednesday. The first half of this week will see rising heat and humidity. Things will turn a little fresher from Thursday afternoon as a weak weather front brings a bit more cloud and possibly some light rain. Temperatures into the weekend will be fairly pleasant at around 19 to 21C. There will be plenty of spells of sunshine. There is a small chance of a few passing showers but they look likely to be few and far between."
UN 'shocked' at Israeli hostage rescue's impact on Gaza civilians,"The four hostages freed on Saturday - Noa Argamani, Almog Meir, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv - were held in two apartment buildings about 200m (656ft) apart in Nuseirat - a historic, urban refugee camp which has seen an influx of displaced people since the start of the war. According to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), the Israeli commandos took Ms Argamanis Hamas guards by surprise and quickly killed them. But the simultaneous move to free Mr Ziv, Mr Kozlov and Mr Meir from the second building sparked a fierce gun battle with their guards, during which a senior Israeli police officer was fatally wounded. As the commandos evacuated to the coast, they came under fire from fighters armed with machine-guns and rocket-propelled grenades, the IDF said. In response, Israeli aircraft, artillery and naval vessels carried out intense strikes on the area. Gazas Hamas-run health ministry said 274 Palestinians were killed and 698 others were injured during the operation. Its figures do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. The Hamas-run Government Media Office reported that 64 children, 57 women and 37 elderly people were among the dead. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said its teams, along with medical staff at al-Aqsa hospital in the nearby town of Deir al-Balah and Nasser hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, treated hundreds of severely injured patients, many of whom were women and children. The charity also quoted one of its Palestinian doctors, Dr Hazem Maloh, as saying that dozens of men, women and children were killed, including his neighbours, friends or relatives. The director of al-Awda hospital in Nuseirat told BBC Arabics Gaza Today programme that 142 dead and 250 injured people were brought to the hospital on Saturday, and that almost a quarter of the fatalities were women and children. A senior official from the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa), meanwhile, said its health centre in Nuseirat treated more than 125 injured people. The IDF's chief spokesman said it was aware of ""under 100"" Palestinian casualties and that it did not know how many of them were ""terrorists"". Several Nuseirat residents interviewed for BBC Arabics Gaza Today programme said they were reluctant to leave the camp in the wake of the operation because nowhere else in Gaza was safe. ""They hit the house opposite us with missiles. I thought my family and I would surely die. Another missile also hit the door of our house. And of course there was widespread destruction,"" Khalil al-Tahran said. ""But where should we flee to?"" Another man, Salem Wali al-Dasht, said: ""Death here will not be different from death [somewhere else]... that is why we decided to remain where we are."" An Israeli doctor who treated the hostages following their rescue said they had suffered a ""harsh experience, with a lot of abuse, almost every day"". ""Every hour, both physical, mental and other types, and that is something that is beyond comprehension,"" Dr Itai Pessach of the Sheba Medical Centre in Ramat Gan told CNN. He also said their time in captivity had ""left a significant mark on their health"". This was due to a ""combination of the psychological stress, malnutrition... medical neglect, being limited [in] space, not seeing the sun, he explained. UN spokesman Mr Laurence noted that the UN human rights offices ability to verify reports of casualties during the hostage rescue operation was limited because of access constraints, but that it still had ""reliable"" contacts on the ground. He also said that UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk welcomed the UN Security Council resolution endorsing a proposed ceasefire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, which was outlined by the US last month. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Israels prime minister had ""reaffirmed his commitment"" to the plan at a meeting on Monday. Hamas has yet to accept it, but Mr Blinken said a statement from the group welcoming the UN resolution was a ""hopeful sign"". The Israeli military launched a campaign in Gaza to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on southern Israel on 7 October, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. More than 37,120 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. A deal agreed in November saw Hamas release 105 of the hostages in return for a week-long ceasefire and some 240 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails. Israel says 116 hostages are still being held, 41 of whom are presumed dead. The four hostages freed on Saturday - Noa Argamani, Almog Meir, Andrey Kozlov and Shlomi Ziv - were held in two apartment buildings about 200m (656ft) apart in Nuseirat - a historic, urban refugee camp which has seen an influx of displaced people since the start of the war.

Israel says 116 hostages are still being held, 41 of whom are presumed dead. The UN human rights office says it is profoundly shocked at the impact on civilians of the Israeli operation in central Gaza that rescued four hostages held by Hamas. Palestinian health officials said hundreds of people were killed and injured in the densely-populated Nuseirat refugee camp on Saturday. Israel's military said fewer than 100 were killed. UN spokesman Jeremy Laurence said the action by Israeli forces seriously calls into question whether the principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution... were respected and could amount to war crimes. He also said Palestinian armed groups could face war crimes charges for continuing to hold hostages in built-up areas and ""putting the lives of Palestinian civilians, as well as the hostages themselves, at added risk. Israels mission to the UN in Geneva accused the UN human rights office of slander. The toll of this war on civilians is first and foremost the product of Hamass deliberate strategy to maximise civilian harm, a statement said. Those who continue to shield Hamas terrorists, including [the UN human rights office], are complicit in the suffering of Palestinians and Israelis alike. The Israeli military has repeatedly said it operates in accordance with international law. There was no immediate comment by Hamas.

UN Disabilities Convention 'should be a priority',"Aindre Reece-Sheerin, an activist and professional disability access consultant, was involved in a road traffic accident almost 30 years ago, which left him a wheelchair user. Mr Reece-Sheerin described the convention as a ""tick-box exercise"" which ensured that the island had met all of the requirements set out by the UN Convention. He said if the island obtained the convention, it ""would be the final piece of the jigsaw after a very, very long battle"". Mr Reece-Sheerin said it would give Guernsey international recognition and would be proof that the island DID comply with world standards on rights for disabled people. The States of Guernsey said it ""continues to progress workstreams that deliver on [the convention's] objectives for the community and will help enable the extension of these conventions to Guernsey"". It added: ""The next milestones this political term are the full implementation of Phase 1 of the legislative framework established in the States Disability & Inclusion Strategy and proposals coming to the States Assembly for Phase 2a."" Deputy Peter Roffey, President of the Committee for Employment and Social Security (CfESS), said he would push for the next CfESS to consider the convention at the beginning of the next assembly. Mr Roffey added: ""At that time, the CfESS will recommend a work programme under its mandate for 2026-2029"". Ms Le Page said the UK government must be satisfied with the island's current Disability, Equality and Inclusion Strategy before extending the convention to Guernsey. The island's first discrimination legislation was introduced in 2023. The law criminalises discrimination on the grounds of disability, carer status, race, religion or belief and sexual orientation. It covers areas including employment, the provision of goods and services, accommodation and membership of clubs and associations. She said that the fundamentals of the convention were in place, but other aspects of the strategy needed to be implemented before the island was eligible for the convention. Ms Le Page said the convention would ensure the on-the-ground work of the disability strategy continues to progress. She said UNCPRD would make sure laws did not change and that ""policies don't discriminate"". Follow BBC Guernsey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

Guernsey Disability Alliance has called for the States to obtain the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD) and to make it a priority for the next term. The UNCRPD is an international treaty which promotes, protects and ensures the rights of disabled people through legislation and the monitoring of government. The convention's monitoring process is every four-to-five years and means that someone outside Guernsey's government can look at the island's policies and legislation.

UN Security Council backs US Gaza ceasefire resolution,"The group has previously said it supports parts of the plan, and it released a statement on Monday welcoming the Security Council resolution. Hamas emphasised its demand for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, as well as the exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The group said it is ready to cooperate with mediators and enter ""indirect negotiations"". Its political leadership in Doha has yet to formally respond to the proposal, according to US and Israeli officials. The proposal would end with a major reconstruction plan for Gaza, which has been largely destroyed in the conflict. The first phase concerns a hostage-prisoner swap as well as a short-term ceasefire. The second phase includes a ""permanent end to hostilities"", as well as a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, according to a text of the US draft resolution. The third phase focuses on the enclave's long-term outlook, and it would start a multi-year reconstruction plan for Gaza. Monday's resolution comes 10 days after President Biden said the Israelis had agreed to the plan. While Mr Biden presented the peace initiative as an Israeli one, the US is also aware Israels own fractious ruling coalition is approaching the plan with reluctance. This extends to outright opposition by some far-right ministers who are threatening to trigger a collapse of the government if the deal progresses. The resignation of former general and centrist Benny Gantz from the war cabinet on Sunday has deepened that sense of instability. President Biden's account on X, formerly Twitter, noted the passage of the resolution. ""Hamas says it wants a ceasefire,"" the post said. ""This deal is an opportunity to prove they mean it."" Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US Ambassador to the UN, said: ""Today we voted for peace"". UK Ambassador Barbara Woodward described the situation in Gaza as ""catastrophic"", adding that the ""suffering has gone on for far too long"". ""We call upon the parties to seize this opportunity and move towards lasting peace which guarantees security and stability for both the Israeli and Palestinian people,"" Ms Woodward said. UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron also welcomed the resolution. Explaining its abstention, Russia's UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia raised concerns over the clarity of the deal and whether Israel had truly accepted the plan to end its military operation in Gaza, as the resolution states. ""Given the many statements from Israel on the extension of the war until Hamas is completely defeated... what specifically has Israel agreed to?"" Mr Nebenzia asked. Despite voting in favour, China also expressed concerns over the text. Its UN ambassador questioned whether this time would be any different to the three previous Security Council resolutions on the conflict, which were not implemented despite being legally binding. On 25 March, the UN Security Council passed a resolution calling for a ceasefire. While the US had previously vetoed similar measures, saying such a move would be wrong while delicate negotiations were continuing between Israel and Hamas, it abstained rather than vetoed the March resolution. Mr Netanyahu said at the time that the US had ""abandoned"" its prior position linking a ceasefire to the release of hostages. The conflict began when Hamas attacked southern Israel on 7 October, killing about 1,200 people and taking some 251 people hostage. The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza has surpassed 37,000 since Israel responded to its attack. The group has previously said it supports parts of the plan, and it released a statement on Monday welcoming the Security Council resolution. Hamas emphasised its demand for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, as well as the exchange for Palestinian prisoners. The group said it is ready to cooperate with mediators and enter ""indirect negotiations"". Its political leadership in Doha has yet to formally respond to the proposal, according to US and Israeli officials. The proposal would end with a major reconstruction plan for Gaza, which has been largely destroyed in the conflict. The first phase concerns a hostage-prisoner swap as well as a short-term ceasefire. The second phase includes a ""permanent end to hostilities"", as well as a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, according to a text of the US draft resolution. The third phase focuses on the enclave's long-term outlook, and it would start a multi-year reconstruction plan for Gaza.

The Hamas-run health ministry says the death toll in Gaza has surpassed 37,000 since Israel responded to its attack. The United Nations Security Council has voted to support a US resolution backing a ceasefire plan for the war in Gaza. The proposal sets out conditions for a ""full and complete ceasefire"", the release of hostages held by Hamas, the return of dead hostages' remains and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners. Fourteen of the 15 Security Council members voted in favour of the US-drafted resolution. Russia abstained. The resolution states that Israel has accepted the ceasefire proposal, and urges Hamas to agree to it too. It means the Security Council joins a number of governments, as well as the G7 group of the world's richest nations, in backing the three-part plan that was unveiled by President Joe Biden in a televised statement on 31 May. Mr Biden described it then as an Israeli ceasefire proposal. The proposal submitted by Israel to the US and fellow mediators Qatar and Egypt   reportedly lengthier than the summary presented by Mr Biden - has not been made public and it is unclear whether it varies from what the president presented. The proposal was agreed to by Israels three-man war cabinet and has not been divulged to the wider government. Some far-right ministers have already made clear they oppose it. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not said directly whether he supports the plan as laid out by President Biden. The resolution was approved shortly after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with foreign leaders, including Mr Netanyahu, in an attempt to build support for the ceasefire deal. Just hours before the UN vote, Mr Blinken said his message to leaders in the region was: ""If you want a ceasefire, press Hamas to say yes."" The group has previously said it supports parts of the plan, and it released a statement on Monday welcoming the Security Council resolution. Hamas emphasised its demand for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza, full Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, as well as the exchange for Palestinian prisoners.

UN confirms 13 staff detained by Houthis in Yemen,"The UN has said the Houthi movement in Yemen has detained two more of its employees, bringing the total number of personnel seized by the group in the past week to 13. The employees were taken in various parts of the conflict-torn country, in what appears to be a co-ordinated crackdown. UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said last week the world body was pursuing all available channels to secure their safe and unconditional release as rapidly as possible. The armed group sees itself as part of an Iranian-led ""axis of resistance"" against Israel, the US and the wider West, and has declared its support for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis have been targeting commercial shipping in the Red Sea, triggering retaliatory air strikes by the US and its allies. Last week, the UN said the Houthis detained 11 of its personnel. UN spokesman Farhan Haq told the BBC on Wednesday two more employees had been detained since then, although he could not specify exactly when. The World Health Organization (WHO) said one of its staff members was among those detained. WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X he was deeply worried about the situation. We are working closely with our UN counterparts to ensure their safety, he said. We urge an immediate and unconditional release. Humanitarian workers must never be a target. Several employees of other international organisations were also detained, reports quoting officials from Yemen's internationally recognised government said. Phones and computers were seized during the raids on the workers' homes and offices, which come after months of Houthi attacks on commercial ships in the Red Sea. The Mayyun Organisation for Human Rights said Houthi intelligence officers targeted 18 aid workers from several groups in Amran, Hudaydah, Saada and Sana'a at the same time on 6 June. Officials told Reuters news agency that multiple members of the US-backed National Democratic Institute (NDI) were targeted. The detentions demonstrate the risks facing aid workers in a country where a decade-long civil war has reportedly killed more than 150,000 people and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. They come as the Houthis face increasing economic difficulties and air strikes carried out by a US-led coalition. The armed group controls the capital of Yemen - Sana'a - and the country's north-west, running a de facto government which collects taxes and prints money. The internationally recognised government of Yemen is based in the southern port of Aden."

UN rights chief warns situation in West Bank âdramatically deterioratingâ,"The top United Nations human rights official has warned of the worsening situation for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and the âunconscionable death and sufferingâ in the Gaza Strip. âThe situation in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, is dramatically deteriorating,â Volker Turk told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on Tuesday. He said 528 Palestinians, 133 of them children, were killed by Israeli military forces or settlers from the start of the current war on Gaza in October to June 15, âin many cases raising serious concerns of unlawful killingsâ. In the same period, 23 Israelis were killed in clashes with Palestinians in the West Bank and Israel, including eight members of security forces, according to the UNâs high commissioner for human rights. Two weeks ago, Turk said people in the West Bank were being âsubjected to day after day of unprecedented bloodshedâ. He spoke as the Israeli military arrested at least five Palestinians during the storming of several towns and villages in Ramallah and el-Bireh governorate in the West Bank, according to the Palestinian news agency Wafa, which also reported a settler attack on Palestinian farmland in the village of Yasuf, east of Salfit. Overnight, Israeli forces arrested dozens of Palestinians in Qusrah near Nablus, also in the West Bank, taking them to a school where they were held and interrogated, Wafa reported. Israeli forces have been rounding up an average of 35 Palestinians a day since the war started, with 9,112 Palestinians imprisoned in Israeli jails as of June 1, nearly double the number of Palestinians jailed on October 1, according to tallies by Palestinian prisoners groups. nan nan Turk also told the 47-member council that he was âappalledâ by the disregard for international human rights and humanitarian law in Gaza, where âthere has been unconscionable death and sufferingâ. âMore than 120,000 people in Gaza, overwhelmingly women and children, have been killed or injured since October 7 as a result of the intensive Israeli offensives,â the official said. âSince Israel escalated its operations into Rafah in early May, almost one million Palestinians have been forcibly displaced yet again while aid delivery and humanitarian access deteriorated further.â More than 37,000 people have been killed and more than 85,400 injured in Israelâs war on Gaza since October 7, the Ministry of Health in the Palestinian enclave said on Tuesday. The revised death toll in Israel from the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel stands at 1,139 with dozens of people still held captive in Gaza. Turk said he was âextremely worried about the escalating situationâ between Israel and the Lebanese group Hezbollah as at least 401 people in Lebanon have been reportedly killed in the fighting, including paramedics and journalists. More than 90,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon, and more than 60,000 have been displaced in Israel with 25 Israeli fatalities, he said. Israelâs permanent mission to the UN in Geneva accused Turk of âcompletely omitting the cruelty and barbarity of terrorismâ in his address to the council. nan nan Turk additionally said global conflicts killed three times as many children and twice as many women in 2023 than in the previous year as the total number of civilian deaths rose by 72 percent. Warring parties were increasingly âpushing beyond boundaries of what is acceptable â and legalâ, he told the council. âKillings and injuries of civilians have become a daily occurrence. â¦ Children shot at. Hospitals bombed. Heavy artillery launched on entire communities. All along with hateful, divisive and dehumanising rhetoric.â As he pointed to other conflicts â including in Ukraine, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sudan and Syria â he noted that funding to help the growing numbers of people in need was dwindling. âAs of the end of May 2024, the gap between humanitarian funding requirements and available resources stands at $40.8bn,â Turk said, in contrast with âalmost $2.5 trillion in global military expenditure in 2023â."
UNESCO proposes putting Stonehenge on 'danger' list,"The vote will be held by the World Heritage Committee (WHC) at a meeting in New Delhi between 21-31July. In its document, the committee ""reiterates its previous requests"" to change the plan, preferably to include a longer tunnel which could go all the way under the site and not disturb the area with exit and entry portals. nan The Stonehenge Alliance - a campaign group against the tunnel - has welcomed the vote. Historian Tom Holland, the group's president, said: ""The new government will have the perfect opportunity to reverse a road scheme that is not only ludicrously expensive, but risks huge damage to the countrys international reputation."" Increased tourism is often seen as a benefit to World Heritage designation, but there are also responsibilities to protect a site. However, the tunnel plan, which has split the local community and led to regular protests and repeated legal battles, has been on the UK government's agenda for decades. Traffic issues on the A303 have been a consistent concern in that time. Liverpool was stripped of its World Heritage status in 2021 after the UN committee claimed developments threatened the heritage value of the city's waterfront.

UV index: Levels explained and how to protect yourself,"nan We need to control our exposure, says Prof Dorothy Bennett, from St George's, University of London. UV is beneficial because it enables our skin to produce essential vitamin D. This is important for the function of bones, blood cells and our immune system. ""But UV is also dangerous because every exposure to UV, especially every sunburn, increases our risk of skin cancer. ""Melanoma, the most dangerous skin cancer, is now the fifth commonest cancer in the UK, the ongoing rise being attributed to sunbathing,"" she said. UV radiation promotes skin cancer by damaging DNA in skin cells. It has also been linked to eye problems, including cataracts. And there is growing evidence that UV light may reduce the body's ability to defend itself against certain diseases. Levels of UV radiation vary throughout the day. The highest readings occur in the four-hour period around ""solar noon"",  which is when the sun is at its highest spot in the sky - usually from late morning to early afternoon. The UV Index (or UVI) is a standard, international measure of ultraviolet radiation. Values start at zero and can rise above 10. The higher the number, the greater the potential for damage to the skin and eyes - and the less time it takes for harm to occur. Countries close to the equator can experience very high UV levels in the middle of the day, throughout the year. Nairobi in Kenya can have UV levels above 10 all year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Majorca in Spain, will normally hit nine in June and July. But the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic never usually gets above five in December and January (when it is summer in the southern hemisphere). According to the WHO, extra sun protection is required when levels are: Protection is required when levels are: No protection is required when levels are: There is no safe or healthy way to get a tan, the UK's national health service (NHS) says. If you want one, Dr Bav Shergill, of the British Association of Dermatologists, says the safest way to tan is ""out of a bottle"" - using self-tan. ""When you tan, ultraviolet light stimulates your skin cells to produce pigment to try and protect the DNA of skin cells - but that protection is minimal -  the equivalent of SP4. ""That is not much protection at all - so you can still burn very early,"" he warns. BBC Weather's Helen Willetts says: ""Your skin can burn just as quickly whether it's 30C or 20C. ""Don't be caught out on cloudy days. UV will still penetrate thin clouds - so even if you don't think it's that sunny, you can still burn."" The amount of UV reaching your skin is not driven by the daily temperature, Dr Michaela Hegglin, from the University of Reading's Department of Meteorology, says. ""UV levels on a bright and breezy late April day in the UK will be about the same as a warm sunny day in August."" Unprotected exposure to UV rays  plays a substantial role in skin ageing - breaking down collagen and elastin fibres in healthy skin. This contributes to wrinkles and loosened folds. The sun's rays also dry out skin, making it coarse and leathery. Tips from the NHS, include: Global research shows people often miss parts of their bodies when putting on sunscreen, Dr Shergill warns. ""People often forget include side of nose by eye - where I have seen a lot of skin cancer,"" he says. Other areas include the groove by the side of the nose and into the cheek, the temples and the upper chest. As a guide, adults should aim to apply about six to eight teaspoons of sunscreen if covering the entire body. Yes. ""I have, for example, seen South Asian people with skin cancer and I have seen people with dual-heritage get skin cancer. ""The skin may look darker, but it doesnt always behave that way from a protection point of view   because there are more genes at play than we think about, "" Dr Shergill says. Regardless of skin colour - the risk of eye damage and of potential harmful effects on the immune system remains."
Unclear how Vaughan Gething could pass budget,"Each financial year the Welsh government has to pass a budget in the Senedd outlining its spending plans for Welsh public services, including the NHS, schools and councils. The process and votes surrounding it generally takes place in the winter. Labour has never had a majority in the Senedd since the advent of devolution. Despite always leading the government, either in coalition or alone, the party has always had to strike deals with opposition members. Currently it has 30 members of the Senedd - exactly half of the parliament's total of 60 seats. The Welsh Labour government needs at least one opposition member to abstain on a budget to get its plans through. The government would have until the end of the financial year to get its plans passed. Should the efforts of ministers to strike a deal fail, the budget for this year would be effectively rolled over into the next, but with a cut. Vaughan Gething lost a vote of no confidence earlier this month after two of his backbenchers were away sick. It followed a months-long row over donations to his leadership campaign, from a company owned by a man previously convicted of environmental offences. Despite calls to resign he has refused to do so, and says he has broken no donation rules. A supporter has said Mr Gething would have won the vote had the absent Senedd members been present. Jane Dodds said: The Welsh Liberal Democrats will not support Labour in passing their budget. Vaughan Gething lost a motion of no confidence in the Senedd and should act accordingly. ""The first minister has had multiple opportunities to do the right thing and return the money. He must now respect the democratic mandate of the Senedd."" Plaid Cymru previously assisted the Welsh government in passing budgets via its co-operation deal, which it scrapped in the summer. BBC Wales was told that the group would take a collective decision on the subject at an appropriate time. But it was also told that it was difficult to envisage how Plaid Cymru could facilitate a budget from a first minister who had lost the confidence of the Senedd. Another individual in the party said they could not see Plaid Cymru being persuaded with offers from the Welsh government, as often happens when ministers try to strike budget deals. A Welsh Conservative Senedd spokesman said: The Welsh Conservatives will never support Labour budgets which divert crucial resources away from key services and into Labour vanity projects like putting 36 more Senedd Members in Cardiff Bay."
Unions recommend school staff to back pay offer,"Speaking on the BBC's Nolan Show, Mr Givan said the new pay offer recognises that support staff are ""absolutely critical"" but that ""many of them are the lowest paid"". He further noted that ""the ability to recruit and retain these staff was very challenging for our schools"". Mr Givan told the Nolan Show that a business case to fund a pay offer had been approved by the finance minister and that an application had been made to the Treasury in London to fund the proposal. ""But because of the election being called, we haven't had a response from the treasury and I went about trying to find an alternative solution,"" he said. ""And while we will still continue to pursue the Treasury, we have found a way forward."" Patrick Mulholland, the deputy general secretary of trade union Nipsa, said it was a substantial offer. ""We are very clear when we are recommending acceptance what we are really recommending is a road map and a way forward,"" Mr Mulholland said. ""That roadmap includes seeking additional funding from Treasury so the full and substantive offer could be applied right across education."" Mr Mulholland acknowledged that the assembly has ""constraints"" on its budget and that ""they probably have maxed out those constraints"". It is through a process of industrial action, campaigning and engagement that we have moved this process on, he told the Nolan Show. Unison says up to 10,000 of its members work in education support roles and will be affected by the proposals. Anne Speed, head of bargaining and representation at Unison NI, said it is recommending acceptance of the proposals. Unison plan to share information with its members in the coming days before holding a vote. Anne Speed said she wanted to remind all the politicians that they pledged support to the education support workers over the past few months and now we want to hold them to that promise. The pay deal put forward by education minister Paul Givan is contingent on funding being approved and secured. The re-grading of staff will cost the Northern Ireland Executive £52m and is to be funded through the June monitoring round. This is when some money carried over from last year, additional money from Westminster and the start of a new 'top-up procedure for Stormonts budget is allocated. The one-off payment would cost the executive about £80m."
Universal claims 92% support for theme park plan,"The company said: ""We are incredibly appreciative of the very warm welcome we received and have been delighted by the enthusiasm and overwhelmingly positive responses provided throughout the public engagement period."" Two public events were held in Bedfordshire where the wider community could learn more information about the proposals. The firm said about 1,500 people attended those meetings and they would now be assessing the feedback received over the last four weeks. Of the 6,000 people surveyed only 4% were not supportive with a further 4% being unsure. In a letter to nearby residents the firm said it had heard concerns about local infrastructure, potential disruption caused during construction, and concerns about noise and the visual impact of the park. The company explained that discussions with relevant transport authorities, local and national governments will continue to ensure all elements are in place to support the project. The company said the next step involved conversations with stakeholders to ""determine whether we can proceed with this project."" Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

University expecting £19m deficit looks to cut staff,"As first reported in the Northampton Chronicle and Echo, one key factor in the deficit is a new rule which stops most international students from bringing family members into the UK during their studies. This has resulted in a 44% drop in applications for UK student visas. UON said it also had to increase its contribution to staff pensions by 5%, and would have to start repaying the capital sum it borrowed to build the new Waterside Campus next year. A UON spokesperson said: ""It is with regret that the University of Northampton has launched this voluntary severance scheme for employees, and while the University has no wish to part ways with valued colleagues, the current financial environment has made this necessary. ""It will only involve those who choose to leave the University voluntarily, and where there is mutual agreement."" The University added that it would ensure ""minimum disruption to teaching and life on campus for students"" and would support staff ""through to completion of the scheme and beyond"". Sonya Andermahr, the branch secretary of the University and College Union (UCU), said: ""UCUs view is that we broadly welcome the scheme as an alternative to compulsory redundancies.

The University of Northampton (UON) said a drop in international student numbers was partly to blame. The institution said other factors were also involved, including rising pension costs and repayments on a new campus. The University added that the scheme was being offered ""with regret"". As first reported in the Northampton Chronicle and Echo, one key factor in the deficit is a new rule which stops most international students from bringing family members into the UK during their studies. This has resulted in a 44% drop in applications for UK student visas. UON said it also had to increase its contribution to staff pensions by 5%, and would have to start repaying the capital sum it borrowed to build the new Waterside Campus next year. A UON spokesperson said: ""It is with regret that the University of Northampton has launched this voluntary severance scheme for employees, and while the University has no wish to part ways with valued colleagues, the current financial environment has made this necessary. ""It will only involve those who choose to leave the University voluntarily, and where there is mutual agreement."" The University added that it would ensure ""minimum disruption to teaching and life on campus for students"" and would support staff ""through to completion of the scheme and beyond"". Sonya Andermahr, the branch secretary of the University and College Union (UCU), said: ""UCUs view is that we broadly welcome the scheme as an alternative to compulsory redundancies. ""However, we feel that the terms of the scheme mean that it probably wont have the desired effect of inducing enough staff to leave to make an appreciable difference to the universitys finances.

Unsolved murder of mother-of-three affected expert,"Prof Wiltshire is a forensic ecologist and botanist, and an expert in palynology  the study of pollen.

Unused PPE worth £1.4bn 'stored inappropriately',"Full Support Healthcare, based in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, was founded by Sarah Stoute and the company is an experienced provider of PPE to the NHS. As demand from hospitals for PPE surged in early 2020, it mobilised huge quantities of stock from China and agreed orders amounting to 13% of the DHSC's total spend on Covid PPE. But information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act from the government's PPE procurement partner Supply Chain Co-ordination Ltd (SCCL), shows that 85% of the two billion items provided will never be used in care settings. It said the equipment would be disposed of, including through a process of generating energy from waste. Through her lawyers, Mrs Stoute told the BBC the shipping containers that transported her company's PPE weren't unloaded ""various times up to 207 days post-arrival"". She said the masks were ""perishable goods and required to be kept cool and dry"" and ""not intended to be stored for a prolonged period in a shipping container, yard or field"". She said the orders ""complied with requirements"". ""It cannot be our responsibility that SCCL ran out of suitable storage space during the pandemic,"" Mrs Stoute added. In November 2020, months after Full Support Healthcare's products arrived in the UK, the Port of Felixstowe in Suffolk became log-jammed with thousands of shipping containers of unloaded PPE. Pictures on social media showed the containers were eventually moved to sites around Suffolk, including Ipswich docks, Mendlesham Airfield and land near Melton railway station. It is not known for certain where Full Support Healthcare's PPE was eventually placed but the additional cost to the taxpayer of storing the products is estimated to have exceeded £100m. Information obtained from SCCL showed 825 million items classed as ""excess to forecast requirements"" were still being held ""where disposal or recycling were possible outcomes"". A spokesperson for SCCL said: ""The Department of Health and Social Care was responsible for the purchasing of PPE during the pandemic and the management of Clipper Logistics."" Health Secretary Victoria Atkins disputed the BBC's findings related to the wasted stock but did not provide an explanation. On ""the wider point"", she said ""the whole country wanted us to get the PPE that our front-line staff needed both in healthcare and in social care, and we managed to procure billions of pieces of PPE equipment"". ""That was absolutely the right thing to do at the time,"" she added. Shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, described the handling of the deal as ""staggering incompetence"". The Liberal Democrats said the public ""deserved transparency on the true cost of these failures"". Peter Upcott, from consultancy firm PPE Specialist, said ""the volume of product would have been known in advance of shipping to the UK"" and the government and SCCL ""should have had a detailed plan of where and how they were going to be stored"". In July last year, an illegal dump of medical aprons, which had been supplied in good order by Full Support Healthcare, was found in the New Forest. Documents seen by the BBC show the stockpile of some 1,550 pallets had been auctioned off by the DHSC to a third-party private company.

The company's lawyers said the Stoutes were only made aware of the volume of unused stock when the BBC told them.

"Up to 200 uni jobs at risk, says politician","The university's vice-chancellor Prof Jon Timmis discussed the challenges facing the higher education sector throughout the UK in an announcement to staff. He said the university - which has around 8,000 students and 2,000 staff - needed to make significant savings. He said this a result of high inflation, domestic student fees that have not increased with inflation and a ""collapse"" in international recruitment markets. ""Like many other universities in Wales, as part of the plans to make savings, the institution will start a voluntary redundancy scheme which will help to reduce expenditure,"" the university said in a statement. The university added that it was hoping to ""avoid compulsory redundancies as far as possible"". Ms Jones told BBC Radio Cymru that the wider impact on Aberystwyth could be significant. ""Voluntary redundancies is an important first step, and hopefully we will not have to move to compulsory redundancies which is something completely different. ""The university is extremely important economically to the economic structure of the county."" Deputy mayor of Aberystwyth, Maldwyn Pryse, said the news created ""uncertainty not only in the university but also in the town"". Last month, Swansea University announced a series of job cuts due to ""financial challenges"". A spokesman said 189 workers had successfully applied for voluntary redundancy since September. The University of South Wales also announced that it was offering voluntary redundancies in order to make financial savings. The Welsh government said it recognised ""the financial pressure on higher education institutions"", adding that ""the Cabinet Secretary for Education engages regularly and constructively with sector leaders on this"". Meanwhile, Cardiff University vice-chancellor Wendy Larner has emailed staff to warn there would be an immediate staff recruitment freeze. Prof Larner said there were sufficient funds to weather the storm in the short-term, but it had to look for ways to cut costs. She said there was no need for panic, but we cant continue to make less money than we spend. ""Our financial position is not good. If we dont take further action, then this year we stand to experience a £35m deficit, and we expect that deficit to be significantly higher next year,"" she wrote. Alongside cuts, she said the university would look at new ways to generate income. The university said it could not rule out voluntary redundancies. Cardiff University's branch of the University and College Union said there were ""mixed messages"" from the university about the financial position and it would ""enter into dispute"" if there were compulsory redundancies."

VW to invest up to $5bn in Tesla rival Rivian,"German car making giant Volkswagen (VW) says it will invest up to $5bn (£3.94bn) in Tesla rival Rivian. The deal creates a joint venture that will allow VW and the US-based electric vehicle (EV) maker to share technology. Rivian shares jumped by almost 50% after the announcement. The tie-up comes as competition intensifies between EV makers and Western countries move to impose tariffs on Chinese imports. Under the agreement, VW said it will initially invest $1bn in the electric truck and SUV maker, with another $4bn to be put into the company by 2026. Founded in 2009, Rivian has not yet posted a quarterly profit. In the first three months of 2024 the company saw a net loss of more than $1.4bn. VW, like other motor industry giants, has come under pressure from rivals like Tesla and China's BYD as it tries to make the shift from fossil fuel-powered vehicles. Meanwhile, some EV start-ups have struggled to make headway in the highly competitive market and as higher interest rates hit demand for big ticket purchases. The partnership will give VW immediate access to Rivian's software allowing the German car maker to use it in its cars. Motor industry giants like VW have also been facing growing competition from Chinese EV makers, which have been expanding globally. Earlier this month, the European Union (EU) warned that it will raise tariffs on Chinese EV imports by as much as 38%. Officials from China and the EU have held talks ahead of a 4 July deadline. A months-long investigation by the European Commission found that Chinese EV companies had been ""unfairly subsidised"". In response, China said the tariffs violated international trade rules and described the investigation as ""protectionism"". The plan came just a month after the US said it will increase import levies on Chinese EVs from 25% to 100%. This week, Canada said that it was considering a similar move to align itself with allies. Separately on Tuesday, Tesla said it would recall most of its Cybertrucks sold in the US over issues with their windscreen wipers and exterior trim. The recalls cover more than 11,000 of the vehicles, which first went on sale at the end of November last year."
Vauxhall factory marks 60 years of manufacturing,"Staff at a Vauxhall factory are celebrating 60 years since the first car rolled off the production line in the north west of England. Past and present employees gathered at the Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire on Wednesday to mark six decades of manufacturing - with one family marking a special milestone. Keith Tabiner worked on the first car, a Vauxhall Viva, made at the plant in 1964 and  has three sons still working at the factory. ""I am like Blackpool rock, I've got Vauxhall right through my veins,"" the 83-year-old-said. The Ellesmere Port plant was built in 1962 and opened for production of the Viva in 1964. Mr Tabiner started working there when he was 23 years old, and returned to the factory on Wednesday to witness one of the cars he worked on in 1964 come back to life. He told BBC Radio Merseyside: ""I'm very proud, because everything has been put down to Vauxhalls, we wouldn't have anything without this place. ""It's completely changed, there's not as many people here but it's trimmed down. It's so clean and all painted, it is very spruce."" Mr Tabiner, has four sons - three of whom work at the plant - meaning the family has a combined 152 years of employment at the site He said it was ""unbelievable"" back in 1964. It was Mr Tabiner's job to spray an engine every minute, something a machine now does. His son, Phil Tabiner, has been working at the factory for 38 years. He said: ""My dad worked in the final finish repair area and I worked in the paint shop, sometimes there would be overtime in my dad's area and he called on our skills, working under my dad, it was quite funny at times."" The Cheshire factory has been the home of several famous models including the Vauxhall Chevette and, since 1980, seven generations of the Astra - and now produces the latest generation of electric vans among other passenger vehicles. The plant is now the UK's first electric-only vehicle plant and the first Stellantis plant worldwide, said Diane Miller, plant director. ""We can't believe 60 years are here already,"" she said. ""A lot of people said the plant is going to close every year ever since we have been here, so we are really pleased that this is such a positive future. ""They never believed it would be here for ten years, the fact that we can get to 60 years, they know now we can get to 100 years, without a doubt.""

Vauxhall-owner may halt UK production over EV plans,"The owner of Vauxhall, Citroën and Peugeot has warned it may halt UK production unless the government does more to boost demand for electric vehicles (EV). Maria Grazia Davino, the boss of Stellantis, said the current government approach to the banning of petrol and diesel cars risked hurting its UK business. She said a decision about whether to close Stellantis's plants in Luton and at Ellesmere Port near Liverpool could come in ""less than a year"". ""Stellantis UK does not stop, but Stellantis production in the UK could stop,"" she told reporters at an industry conference on Tuesday. Stellantis owns several other well-known car brands, including Fiat, Jeep, Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Maserati and Opel. The UK government initially set a goal of 2030 to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars, but delayed the plan by five years to give consumers more time to make the transition to electric vehicles. Explaining the decision, the prime minister said the ""upfront cost"" of EVs was still too high. Stellantis makes electric vans at its Ellesmere Port plant and has previously said it will start making electric vans at its Luton plant in 2025. Speaking to reporters, Ms Davino said: We have undertaken big investments in Ellesmere Port and in Luton, with more to come. But if this market becomes hostile to us, we will enter an evaluation for producing elsewhere. Her comments follow a long tussle between car manufacturers and the government over the push towards electric vehicles, the demand for which has slowed recently. Competition from cheap Chinese electric vehicles has led manufacturers to worry further about giving up too much profit for a slow market. It means that you have to increase discounts to push the market that isnt there. And this has a number of consequences for the business case, Ms Davino said. Both the Conservative and Labour parties have policies aimed at reducing emissions and increasing air quality. Meanwhile, the EU has said Chinese EVs were unfairly subsidised by its government, and threatened to impose punitively high taxes on Chinese imports."

Views shared on renewable energy ahead of election,"It makes me very proud,"" said Martin Edwards of the wind farm he helped to create on his family's farm at Delabole in the early 1990s. The idea to harness the power of the wind came after the roof was blown off their house in a storm. ""It was a fantastic thing to do,"" he said. ""It really did demonstrate to the big players out there that wind power was commercially viable."" The 63-year-old wants to see more renewable energy projects to help limit the impact of climate change. I think we need to see more onshore wind, more energy storage and more solar [power].  Much more of it smaller scale, on barn and factory roofs. ""All new builds should have solar on them automatically, theres no reason why not.  Thats the way it will go to get to net zero."" But the farmer said he was concerned ""too much has been left until way too late"". ""We need to tackle things much faster.  We now need to do more than we would have done if we'd done something 10 or 15 years ago."" The owner of Darts Farm in Topsham uses an app on his phone to track how much energy is being generated by the solar panels that cover the roof of his business. Its amazing isnt it? Its free energy, said Michael Dart who started installing solar panels on his property about 12 years ago. Weve had a capital investment on all the panels but weve now got free energy when the sun shines,"" he said. ""Anything government can do to help stimulate the change from fossil fuels to green energy has to be good but its got to be done in an affordable way.  We need a long strategy, not a short term panic."" Mark Marriott, from near Holsworthy in Devon, objected to plans for a solar farm with about 70,000 panels on land adjacent to his land. We support solar. Weve got it on our house, but we dont support it ruining the countryside,"" he said. Id like to see building and planning regulations make all new houses have solar, air source heat pumps and batteries.

Dr Phil Bratby, from the Devon branch of the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), said they were very concerned about more onshore wind and solar farms. We believe you cant power the country on renewable energy,"" he said. ""We dont want to see more farm land lost to these developments."" Dr Bratby said developing small scale modular nuclear reactors was the answer.

The Energy Market Analyst said: ""The government has set ambitious net zero by 2050 targets and one of the key ways to get us there and move us towards that target is to introduce more renewable electricity into our system."" She added: ""The sun doesn't always shine and the wind doesn't always blow but more often than not they compliment each other.

Vintage cycle club closes after more than 40 years,"""I am really sad about it - it was my baby,"" said Mr Bedford.

""I have enjoyed every minute of it, we have met so many great people, made new friends, it has been wonderful,"" he added. ""We only have four members left who can still ride a bike, so we can't do displays with so few people.

""The Peterborough Vintage Cycle Club ceased last October - they started in 1953,"" said Mr Bedford. ""We experienced the same thing as them, declining numbers and youngsters not wanting to get involved."" Mr Bedford said he had no plans to sell his large collection of vintage cycles and wanted to ""carry on collecting"". ""I will continue giving talks and doing displays just by myself,"" he said.

Von der Leyen nominated to stay on in top EU job,"EU leaders have nominated current European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen for a second five-year term in the bloc's top job at a summit in Brussels. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas was picked as the EU's next foreign affairs chief and former Portuguese Prime Minister António Costa was chosen as the next chairman of EU summits. All three candidates are from centrist, pro-EU factions. The European Parliament is due to vote on the nominations for Ms von der Leyen and Ms Kallas. Ms von der Leyen is from Germanys centre-right, Mr Costa is a socialist and Ms Kallas a liberal. The leadership package represents continuity for the EU at a time of geopolitical uncertainty. It comes despite a surge in support for hard-right parties in the European Parliament elections earlier this month. But there has been resistance from Italys Prime Minister, Giorgia Meloni. Before the summit she said the plans ignored the successes of hard-right parties like her own in the recent elections for the European Parliament. Ms Meloni has worked on cultivating a constructive relationship with the EU political mainstream, but she abstained from the vote for Ms von der Leyen and voted against Mr Costa and Ms Kallas. Ms Meloni, who heads the right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) bloc in the European Parliament, was notably not included in talks on the nominations despite the fact that the ECR became the third largest group in the parliament following the European elections. Addressing the Italian parliament on Wednesday, she said angrily that European voters had asked the EU to ""take a different path to the one it has travelled on so far"". Without naming names, she criticised ""those who argue that citizens are not mature enough to take certain decisions, and [who believe] that oligarchy is essentially the only acceptable form of democracy"". Approval from the European Parliament could be a trickier challenge. Ms von der Leyen needs 361 votes in order to be confirmed for a second term. Theoretically, support from the centre-right European Peoples Party, liberals and social democrats would give her enough support. But it is a tight margin. Diplomats say Ms von der Leyen may seek to win Ms Meloni's backing by giving Italy a powerful post in the commission. ""I would plain and simply like to express my gratitude to the leaders who endorsed my nomination for second mandate as president of the European Commission,"" said Ms von der Leyen. If she is approved by the European Parliament, one of her main tasks will be to see how Brussels can keep supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia - something that could be complicated if Donald Trump wins November's presidential election in the US. Ms Kallas is also a strong supporter of Ukraine and a hawkish critic of the Kremlin and Russias President Vladimir Putin. Moscow put her on a list of wanted criminals after her government removed Soviet-era war monuments. Some critics have expressed concern that her uncompromising stance could be a hindrance in her new role as the EUs top diplomat - both externally and within the bloc itself. Ms Kallas said she was ""really honoured by the support"" and described the role as an ""enormous responsibility"". ""My aim is definitely to work for European unity, protect European interests."" Mr Costa praised Ms Kallas and Ms von der Leyen, saying: ""I'm sure our collaboration will be very successful to serve Europe and European citizens."" ""Europe and the world are facing challenging moments, yes,"" he said after his nomination. ""But the European Union has demonstrated its resilience in the past, always finding strengths in the unity, and building unity between member states will be my main priority when I take up my position in December focused on putting on track the strategic agenda which European Council has approved today."" Mr Costa, who resigned as prime minister last year, will replace Belgium's former Prime Minister Charles Michel. Ms Kallas will take over from Spain's Josep Borrell."
Voters call for action on climate change,"The Environment Agency said the flood was a result of both surface water and the breach of the River Rothers defences - but the agency was criticised by Rotherham MP Sarah Champion and councillors for not issuing flood warnings early enough. Ms Egan wants the next government to offer more support to flood victims. Obviously dealing with climate change itself is really important but the government needs to look at insurance because it is very difficult and much more expensive to get insured so that is a huge issue. Also the insurers will replace like for like whereas we now want things which are flood resilient and the process needs to be quicker and easier. The truth is people will not want to be on a flood plain if those measures are not in place and suddenly all these houses will be empty. We really do not want to leave here, but there has definitely been moments of thinking, 'should we go and find somewhere else?' ""We love Catcliffe, we love this building but it has definitely been a thought process because it is going to happen again. Structural engineer Miriam Graham knows all about making buildings climate friendly. She works for Arup and leads a national network group looking at structural engineering sustainability. She wants the government to make carbon assessments mandatory in the UK construction industry and to provide incentives for companies to use low-carbon alternatives. And she says building something from scratch is not the best option. We should look at what we already have, as the most sustainable solution is to not build anything at all. If we can retain and reuse buildings, be creative with them, that is going to save a lot of carbon and emissions. If we do need to knock a building down, we need to retain those materials, such as extracting beams. ""The government has a really big role to play in helping accelerate how we can deconstruct and use more of those materials and stop them from being wasted. It is not just flooding which is destroying homes and livelihoods. Wildfires ripped through South Yorkshire in July 2022 when temperatures reached more than 39 degrees. Yet the environment does not seem to be a hot topic this general election. BBC research shows climate change is only in the top 10 issues for voters aged under 34. Dr Tom Payne is a senior lecturer at Sheffield Hallam University. He recently staged a performance at Sheffields Crucible theatre which will kickstart ""Storm-Cloud"", a major programme of engagement, exhibitions, performances and films around the climate emergency. A couple of years ago he co-led the Ark Sheffield project in which people reflected on what the floods meant to them. He said: The conversations illustrated people's very immediate concerns with the NHS or having enough money to go to the shops and buy food this month. ""Often conversations around the climate emergency are secondary to those. I can see how political parties focus on those very immediate concerns however all those things like the NHS, migration and the economy are linked to the climate emergency and will get progressively worse if we don't tackle them. The Conservatives say they will meet their goal of reaching net zero by 2050. They would treble offshore wind power and approve new small nuclear power stations. Labour would spend £1.7bn a year on a Great British Energy company to create 650,000 jobs, drive industrial renewal, lower bills and create secure supplies of clean energy. The Liberal Democrats have a net zero target of 2045. They would speed up the deployment of solar and wind power so 90% of power would be generated by renewables by 2030. The Green Party wants to reach net zero by 2040 at the latest and would phase out nuclear power. Reform UK say they would scrap any plans to reach net zero.

WW1 soldiers laid to rest 110 years after deaths,"In 2009, French historian Jerome Buttet was researching war graffiti in a cave near Chassemy, when he discovered a makeshift grave with an inscription. It read: ""15 Sept 1914, Here lies Sjt Smith and 3 Gnrs, 29th Battery RFA."" Mr Buttet brought in archaeologists, who discovered two sets of remains in the cave. Ministry of Defence (MoD) detectives at Imjin Barracks in Gloucestershire carried out research and DNA testing, which allowed them to identify the two fallen men as Sgt Smith from Gloucestershire and Gunner Lightfoot from Edinburgh. Both served with the 29th Battery of Royal Field Artillery. Ms Kruk still has a box of her grandmother Netty Lightfoot's belongings.

Gunner Charles Lightfoot and Sgt John Smith died two months into the war. They were killed during the Battle of Aisne in France in September 1914 but their bodies were not found until 15 year ago. Gunner Lightfoot's granddaughter Sue Kruk travelled to France from her home in Hayling Island, Hampshire, for the military burial ceremony in their honour. In 2009, French historian Jerome Buttet was researching war graffiti in a cave near Chassemy, when he discovered a makeshift grave with an inscription. It read: ""15 Sept 1914, Here lies Sjt Smith and 3 Gnrs, 29th Battery RFA."" Mr Buttet brought in archaeologists, who discovered two sets of remains in the cave. Ministry of Defence (MoD) detectives at Imjin Barracks in Gloucestershire carried out research and DNA testing, which allowed them to identify the two fallen men as Sgt Smith from Gloucestershire and Gunner Lightfoot from Edinburgh. Both served with the 29th Battery of Royal Field Artillery. Ms Kruk still has a box of her grandmother Netty Lightfoot's belongings. Among the items she kept was a letter dated 18 October 1914, more than a month after Gunner Lightfoot was killed.

Was there a massacre after Kenya's anti-tax protests?,"In one video, we see security forces advancing towards the protesters and some can be seen shooting - it is unclear from the video whether at the protesters or in the air, and it is impossible to know whether the guns were firing live rounds, rubber bullets or blanks. We are yet to come across any verifiable video or image of people killed around that time. A graphic image circulating online shows a body with at least eight bullet holes, but the nature of how it was taken makes it challenging to verify because it is taken at very close range and there are no clearly identifiable location points. In one video clip, which we were able to authenticate by verifying identifiable locations,  people can be seen walking towards Githurai. Smoke can be seen rising from the area from a distance as the person filming walks towards the suburb. Those walking alongside the person filming are raising their hands up to show they do not pose any danger. Another video filmed nearby the roundabout shows dozens of people gathered around the area and running away from the scene as gunfire can be heard. In some of the videos, you can see what looks like vehicles belonging to the military or police on the road, and in two of the clips those filming talk about the road having been blocked by protesters. Although the details are hard to verify, it is clear that a major security operation took place in the suburb. But an analysis of social media shows misinformation about what had happened was already starting to take hold. BBC Verify found that old videos filmed in 2022 were being reshared on social media, purporting to show protesters walking along a street carrying flaming torches at this week's protests. The BBC Global Disinformation Unit had previously investigated the clip and discovered that it was recorded in Ghana two years ago. This is not the first time it has been misrepresented. Despite the incomplete understanding of what happened in Githurai, as Kenyans woke up on Wednesday morning reports began to spread of an alleged massacre. It was discussed by radio DJs, reported as rumour by some Kenyan newspapers and widely discussed online. The word ""Githurai"" was trending on social media sites, including X. The state-funded Kenya National Commission on Human Rights said it had ""received unverified reports of scores of residents who were killed by the stray bullets"", which it said it would investigate. And later that day the allegations were given new credibility when they were referred to directly by a leading legal organisation, the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) - a body which represents the countrys lawyers and works to promote the rule of law. Responding to widespread public anger at alleged police brutality outside parliament, LSK president Faith Odhiambo also called for an international investigation into what she called the massacre in Githurai. In a press conference, carried by some Kenyan broadcasters, she said: We call upon the international community to conduct independent investigations on the massacre meted on the residents of Githurai, Nairobi, on the night of 25 June 2024. I dare ask, is Githurai a protected area? Is Githurai an area that members of the public should not stay, should not live? Why was there a massacre where people are living peacefully? We demand answers to those questions. She added: From social media, people have been saying that over 100 people were killed yesterday. So we cannot allow those lives to go uncounted, that the people who caused those deaths to be held accountable. Ms Odhiambo has subsequently told the BBC that she now accepts she did not have evidence of a mass killing at the time that she gave her press conference and said she was willing to withdraw the allegation a massacre had occurred. In an interview on Thursday, she said the LSK intended to establish a help desk in Githurai to slowly collect evidence of what had happened - and said in previous incidents of mass shootings in Kenya, bodies had been buried and only found later. She said: We need to ascertain the number. We want to set up a team to investigate the concerns that were made, the rumours that bodies were collected. Asked specifically whether she stood by her decision to make the allegation of a massacre, she said: Maybe in hindsight I accept that I shouldnt have called it a massacre. Other public bodies also spoke publicly about a massacre at Githurai. The word was used on Wednesday afternoon in a statement issued by the Police Reform Working Group, an alliance of organisations that campaign for better policing. The statement said: Reports show that police shot several people in Githurai in Nairobi - one over 40 times - between 10pm and 1am, way after the protest ended. We believe that the massacre that happened in Githurai was fueled by an inciteful, and insensitive address President William Ruto gave yesterday at State House. Ruto spoke at 9 pm and threatened Kenyans, and the massacre started at 10pm. A spokesperson for the Police Reform Working Group on Friday told the BBC the organisations position was now that the alleged massacre at Githurai was unverified, but declined to comment any further on its statement from Wednesday. By Wednesday afternoon the sense of public anger about the incident in Githurai was so significant that the BBC sent a reporting team to investigate on the ground. But by the time the crew arrived, the bustling suburb was largely calm as traders carried on with their businesses. Many of those we spoke to confirmed Tuesdays violent confrontations between civilians and security forces. A police vehicle was burned. We dismantled the shell and sold what remained of it as scrap metal, one resident told us. But no-one we spoke to reported seeing any dead bodies, nor could they identify anyone who had been killed. However, the BBC did track down a teenager who was shot during the incident in the suburb. Winfrey Wairimu, 16, was hit by a stray bullet as she visited her mother at her confectionery stall by a bus stop when a crowd of people ran by, pursued by security forces. Ms Wairimus mother Tabitha Mwaniki, 37, spoke to the BBC about what happened. Security officers were chasing them, lobbing teargas canisters and firing gunshots, she said. She called out Mum! and I thought she was just in shock because of the chaos shed witnessed. I called her name, Wairimu, Wairimu, but she didnt answer. The BBC has since visited the injured teenager and her mother at Nairobis Kenyatta National Hospital, where she underwent surgery on Wednesday for a bullet wound on her waist. By Wednesday evening details began emerging of different allegations from Githurai - of protesters attacking police. In its main evening bulletin on Wednesday, Kenyas Citizen TV reported that 20 officers had been injured after a police vehicle was attacked - and repeated the allegation heard earlier by the BBC that another police vehicle had been burned. Despite the confusing picture about what had happened, Githurai remained part of the conversation in Nairobi as the week progressed. On Thursday, BBC reporters met several people joining renewed protests in the capital who said news of the alleged massacre had in part inspired them to demonstrate. One woman told us: People were massacred yesterday at home. I dont understand why people are not actually talking about what happened in Githurai. The internet was down, electricity was down. So many deaths were recorded, we were hearing gunshots from wherever. But theres nobody actually talking about what happened in Githurai. Nobody is explaining why that number of people was killed there. I barely got any sleep yesterday just thinking about how many people died in Githurai, she added. Asked to respond to the fact that no evidence had emerged of a mass killing in the suburb, she said: There are videos of people being shot down, but at that time things were down - the internet was down, electricity was down. Kenyas Standard newspaper has reported that there were three deaths in Githurai, something the BBC has been unable to confirm and an allegation on which the police have declined to comment. The BBC has asked Kenyas police about what happened in Githurai but the force declined to comment. A human rights advocate who lives and works in Githurai, Njoki Gachanja, told investigations platform Africa Uncensored that the reports of a massacre were untrue. All these bodies that people have been talking about  that did not happen in Githurai, she said in a video posted on Africa Uncensoreds account on Wednesday. She said the organisation she works for, Githurai Social Justice Centre, had been on the ground since morning, held community meetings and forums trying to look for these victims or their families, but had found no evidence of killings at the reported scale. Id like to confirm that I live in Githurai and theres no massacre in Githurai. Ms Gachanja did say they had traced one body with bullet wounds to City Mortuary, the main government morgue. She confirmed hearing the confrontation between security forces and youths in the area on Tuesday from around 18:00 to 20:00 local time with more gunfire heard overnight. Many in Kenya believe the government, police and security forces have serious questions to answer about their response to the protests. Kenyas international allies and even the UN secretary-general expressed concern about Tuesdays security response and warned the country to protect the right to peaceful demonstration. Yet it is clear that amid the chaos, not every claim made about the authorities was true. It may be that in time new details do emerge to support claims of police brutality in Githurai. But by Friday evening the respected Kenya National Commission on Human Rights, whose figures have been used by many global media organisations, said its confirmed death toll linked to the protests this week remained at 23, including 19 in Nairobi during the actual protests on Tuesday. And after the alleged massacre in Githurai there is still no evidence of mass killings, with at least some of those who made the allegations now prepared to accept there is doubt over what happened. The story of how news spread of what happened, or rather what may not have happened, in the suburb is a reminder of the power of online communication. Social media has become a significant tool in inspiring and co-ordinating grassroots protests and it has been used in recent weeks in Kenya to make a powerful impact. But as the BBCs work to assess the evidence in the case of Githurai appears to demonstrate, it has the ability too to mislead and add fuel to an already raging fire.

On Tuesday citizens watched in horror as a bloody day unfolded in Nairobi. The countrys police watchdog is now investigating allegations that officers shot dead protesters outside the national parliament during a day of demonstrations in which at least 23 people are reported to have died. Within hours many Kenyans began to hear reports of another, even more brutal incident - an alleged massacre of civilians in Githurai, a residential suburb 14km (nine miles) north-east of central Nairobi. The story quickly took hold on social media, where some people claimed more than 200 had been killed. Reports referencing the rumours emerged in the media, followed on Wednesday by statements by reputable organisations calling for an independent inquiry. When protesters returned to the heart of Nairobi on Thursday, many spoke of the alleged massacre in Githurai as a reason. But a BBC investigation has found no evidence of mass killings in Githurai - raising questions about how readily misinformation can spread amid a crisis. Here we unpick how the story unfolded. The first sense of anything significant taking place in the suburb emerged on Tuesday evening. It had been a chaotic day across Kenya, with tens of thousands attending protests in central Nairobi which quickly escalated, leading to the storming of parliament, the shooting dead of protesters, looting and attacks on police. After the shocking violence outside and inside parliament the demonstrators began to disperse, many headed towards their homes on the citys outskirts. Githurai is a densely populated residential area on the Thika Highway, the main road north from the city centre. It has rows of formal housing as well as areas of informal settlements, home to tens of thousands of commuters who make the daily trip into central Nairobi. As dusk fell many Githurai residents suddenly became aware of a significant presence of police and what many believed were the military. Communications were patchy on Tuesday evening, with internet outages across Kenya and mobile phone signals periodically going down. But as news of events in Githurai emerged, some videos did make their way to social media. BBC Verify has managed to authenticate several videos posted by six different online users and from different locations around the area. They show evidence of heavy and continuous gunfire in Githurai, around the main roundabout on the Thika Highway. In one video, we see security forces advancing towards the protesters and some can be seen shooting - it is unclear from the video whether at the protesters or in the air, and it is impossible to know whether the guns were firing live rounds, rubber bullets or blanks. We are yet to come across any verifiable video or image of people killed around that time.

Watchdog wants transparency from mortgage lenders,"The investigation by the JCC said that consumers in Jersey ""struggle to understand"" why they have pay up to £20,000 more per £100,000 of loan over the lifetime of a mortgage when borrowing over 25 years, than UK customers of the same bank. It said the discrepancy ""raises serious questions about the price Islanders are paying for living in an international finance centre."" The report added many of these banks still align with their UK parents, in terms of branding, marketing material and products which track the Bank of England base rate. The JCC wrote to lenders in March, asking for an explanation to ensure a ""fair and transparent mortgage market"". Banks in the island said the difference in rates was due to their status as ring-fenced and separate entities from their UK counterparts. The JCC noted rates are further influenced by the higher savings rates offered in Jersey, which are designed to attract investment. However, it said the investigation's findings ""highlight the need for greater transparency from the banking industry to help consumers better understand the differences."" It added the government needs to reassess ""the balance between attracting inward investment and ensuring affordable home ownership for Islanders."" Assistant Minister for Financial Services, Deputy Elaine Millar, said the government was aware of the the report and ""may look to discuss its contents with the authors in due course."" Jerseys housing market has many different characteristics to that of the United Kingdom and there is significantly less choice of mortgage lenders due to the modest market size,"" said Ms Millar. ""We continue to encourage banks in Jersey to offer a range of competitive mortgage products to Islanders and will continue to monitor this availability closely. Follow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook. Send your story ideas to channel.islands@bbc.co.uk. A consumer watchdog investigation into why Jersey residents are paying more for their mortgages has called for ""greater transparency"" from the banking industry. The report by the Jersey Consumer Council (JCC) found rates offered by lenders in Jersey were about 1% higher than rates offered by the same banks in the UK. Banks in Jersey said the higher rates were due to their ""operational structure"", but the JCC said it had led to ""confusion"" for customers. The government said it was encouraging Jersey lenders to offer competitive rates and would continue to monitor mortgage availability.

The report added many of these banks still align with their UK parents, in terms of branding, marketing material and products which track the Bank of England base rate. The JCC wrote to lenders in March, asking for an explanation to ensure a ""fair and transparent mortgage market"". Banks in the island said the difference in rates was due to their status as ring-fenced and separate entities from their UK counterparts. The JCC noted rates are further influenced by the higher savings rates offered in Jersey, which are designed to attract investment. However, it said the investigation's findings ""highlight the need for greater transparency from the banking industry to help consumers better understand the differences."" It added the government needs to reassess ""the balance between attracting inward investment and ensuring affordable home ownership for Islanders."" Assistant Minister for Financial Services, Deputy Elaine Millar, said the government was aware of the the report and ""may look to discuss its contents with the authors in due course."" Jerseys housing market has many different characteristics to that of the United Kingdom and there is significantly less choice of mortgage lenders due to the modest market size,"" said Ms Millar. ""We continue to encourage banks in Jersey to offer a range of competitive mortgage products to Islanders and will continue to monitor this availability closely. Follow BBC Jersey on X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook.

What Biden and Trump said after high-stakes debate,nan nan nan
What Kate video tells us about royal strategy,"The Princess of Wales and her family had asked for privacy. Instead, on a beautiful spring day, directly addressing the camera, we saw a princess having to come to terms with shocking news - and having to make it public. For weeks there have been claims that Kensington Palace's PR strategy was failing, as online rumours went viral and then evidence-free conspiracy theories were repeated in media outlets around the world. There was the disaster of the Mother's Day photograph, which was meant to quell the conspiracies and instead launched many more (although I doubt the PR team knew the image had been edited when it was released). Catherine's emotional video certainly feels like a reset. Palace insiders have been keen to make clear it was always the plan; that, just as the King informed the nation he had cancer, the princess was always minded she would too - and the timing was designed to coincide with the children's school holidays. But as she and her family face whatever lies ahead, there's anger at what some perceive as bullying of the princess, with the suggestion that she was forced into making the video, rather than the more usual route of a written statement, by the relentless and far-fetched swirling conspiracy theories. Sir Craig Oliver, former Downing Street director of communications told me: ""One of the subtexts of the Princess of Wales's message is clearly - please think before you indulge in hurtful speculation."" Kensington Palace had been clear that Catherine had a right to privacy. It will have been horrified by how quickly rumours spread once the princess was no longer in the public eye. How upsetting it must have been, in the midst of the diagnosis, to have questions about her marriage aired on American television, and lurid speculation rife online. Even more upsetting perhaps, to know how many people were enjoying indulging in the rumours. In a very different way, Catherine's video reminded me of Elizabeth II's TV address after Princess Diana died. The late queen had felt compelled to appear in public, after criticism, on that occasion in the press, about her absence. She too had been trying to protect her family, prioritising her grandsons after the loss of their mother. She had to change tack, as her role as a grandmother and her role as queen pulled her in different directions. For weeks, we've heard criticism that the Palace has lost the narrative, that the royal brand had taken a battering. It's clearly been difficult to manage the demands of the nation and the demands of the family - and Catherine's health news casts fresh light on why she hadn't been seen, until very recently. Her video and the communications around it have brought praise from those who understand how palace PR works. Former Sun editor Stuart Higgins, who is also a cancer patient, applauded Catherine's ""enormous courage, dignity and composure to face the camera"" instead of letting Kensington Palace issue a message on her behalf. Revealing a cancer diagnosis is a ""very personal decision and only she and her closest family can make such a big decision to go public with such a health bombshell"", he said. Mr Higgins said he did not believe the media furore around Catherine pushed her to disclose her diagnosis, but only reflected ""massive concern, love and respect for a woman who will be our future Queen"". ""I think we should all wish her well and look forward to seeing her when she feels ready to see us,"" he said. Charles Anson, former press secretary to Elizabeth II, told the BBC that ""getting the right sort of sequence of information is a very difficult thing to do in the internet age"". But the princess's video ""was absolutely right in terms of telling the public at the same time as creating a bit of an area of protection for the family"". But there's no doubt there has been real shock at how virulent and unkind social media and some global media outlets have been over the past months. As several people with an understanding of Palace public relations put it to me, it's been the worst example of it ever. PR guru Mark Borkowski says communications for the royals is ""the most difficult job in the world you have good days and bad days"", but that the princess' statement ""settles everything for a moment"". ""They've managed to take back control."" The Princess of Wales's video has prompted a huge outpouring of love and sympathy across the UK and further."
What are the parties saying about women's rights and gender identity?,"Sir Keir Starmer and Rishi Sunak were both quizzed about women-only spaces in their final head-to-head debate before the election. So what have the main parties said about transgender rights, women's rights and gender identity so far? Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has suggested voters face a ""crystal-clear choice""  at this election about the protection of single-sex spaces. The Conservatives say that -  if re-elected - they will ""protect female-only spaces and competitiveness in sport"", by rewriting the Equality Act to make clear that sex as a protected characteristic means biological sex. ""Keir Starmer has not matched my pledge to reform the Equality Act to pass new law...he's not sure, like I am, that sex means biological sex, and that's how you protect female-only spaces and services,"" the PM told the audience at Wednesdays debate. Guidance around the Equality Act says certain spaces can be single-sex only, if it is proportionate and intended to achieve a legitimate aim such as privacy or the prevention of trauma. The Conservatives suggest change is needed to clarify that sex in this context means biological sex. Some people believe that trans women  that is, people who were born male but who now identify as female  should have access to the single-sex spaces and events that are specifically for women. This is contested by some womens rights groups, and they are pressing for clarification of the Equality Act so that single-sex spaces such as womens prisons, rape crisis centres, sports teams and changing rooms, are only open to biological women. In May, the government released draft guidance that schools in England ""should teach the facts about biological sex and not use any materials that present contested views as fact, including the view that gender is a spectrum"". Parents would have a right to know if their child wants to be treated as the opposite sex, the Conservative manifesto says, with schools having to involve parents in decisions about their children. Unlike Labour and the Lib Dems, the Conservatives have not promised to ban conversion therapy, which attempts to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity. There is no legal definition, but in practice it means trying to stop or suppress someone from being gay, or from identifying as a different gender to their sex recorded at birth. Theresa May first pledged to ban it in 2018, and the government launched a consultation about how that would work. But the party now says it needs to take more time before deciding whether existing laws are strong enough or extra protection is needed. Sir Keir Starmer defended his position on single-sex spaces in Wednesday's debate. ""It's very important that we protect female-only spaces,"" he said, adding that he treats transgender people ""as I treat all human beings - with dignity and respect"". He referred to guidance around the existing Equality Act, which says that a trans person with a Gender Recognition Certificate could be prevented from using a single-sex service in some circumstances. It is not the first time he has been challenged about his messaging around women and transgender people. In 2021, Labour MP Rosie Duffield, who has consistently argued that sex is a matter of biological fact, posted a message on social media stating: Only women have a cervix.""  Questioned about this, Sir Keir criticised her position, saying it was not right. But in a recent BBC Question Time debate, he said he agreed with former Prime Minister Tony Blairs comment, that ""biologically, a woman is with a vagina and a man is with a penis"". He followed that up by saying some people dont identify with their birth sex, adding: ""My view in life is to respect and give dignity to everyone, whatever their position."" He suggested his earlier comments were made in the context of a toxic and hardline atmosphere around trans rights. His comment prompted author JK Rowling to write in the Times newspaper that she would struggle to vote for him. She said she was propelled by freedom of speech and observable truth and believed Labour was dismissive and often offensive towards women fighting to retain sex-based rights  she said the party had abandoned women. nan Labours education spokeswoman has refused to clarify whether the party would scrap the Conservatives proposed ban on schools in England teaching pupils about gender identity. Bridget Phillipson told the BBC protected characteristics such as gender reassignment should be taught but on a factual basis at an appropriate age[not] based on contested ideology. In its manifesto, Labour has pledged to ban conversion therapy, and would include transgender people in that ban. It has also pledged to remove the indignities from the process of applying for a gender recognition certificate, which allows a person to change their legal sex. It pledged to ""modify, simplify and reform"" the process, while keeping the requirement for a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria The Lib Dems would seek to completely overhaul the gender recognition process, removing the requirement for a medical diagnosis if a person wanted to change the sex listed on their birth certificate. Like Labour, the party promises to ban conversion therapy outright, while non-binary identities - those who do not consider themselves to have a solely male or female identity -would be recognised in law. The party says it would also require large employers to monitor and publish data on LGBT+ employment levels, pay gaps and progression, building on the mandatory reporting around gender pay gap data that already exists. John Swinney, who took over as SNP leader in May, has said he will ""wait and see"" after the general election about pursuing changes to gender recognition rules. The party had previously tried to enact a controversial bill that would allow transgender people to change their legal sex through self-identification - so without the need for a relevant medical diagnosis. It was blocked by the UK government last year, on the grounds that it would interfere with equality law in the rest of the UK. Previous SNP leaders Nicola Sturgeon and Humza Yousaf backed the idea of self-ID, but in 2019 some Scottish MPs, including the now-deputy leader Kate Forbes,  urged the Scottish government not to rush into ""changing the definition of male and female"". In its election manifesto, the party says that if Scotland were to become independent from the rest of the UK ""we would have the full powers to improve equality in law and society"". In its list of pledges, Reform UK says divisive, woke ideology has captured our public institutions. The party says transgender indoctrination is causing irreversible harm to children, and plans to ban what it describes as transgender ideology in schools in England. In practice, this means no gender questioning, social transitioning or pronoun swapping. The party would also scrap the Equality Act and diversity, equality and inclusion rules, which the party suggests are lowering economic productivity. When leader Nigel Farage was recently asked on BBC 5Live how he would interact with transgender people as the opposition party, he said that while we should respect the rights of transgender peoplewe equally must respect the rights of women too, and women-only spaces. He also suggested that a scenario in which someone who had gone through male puberty competed in a womens swimming race shouldnt happen. The Green Party supports the idea of trans and non-binary people to be legally recognised in their chosen gender through self-identification. It also supports a change in law so an X could be added as a gender marker in the passports of non-binary and intersex people, if they wanted to use it. Like the Lib Dems and others, Plaid Cymru would seek to introduce a policy of self-identification if someone wanted to change their legally recognised gender, without the need for a medical diagnosis."
What do heatwaves do to the body and who is at risk?,"As the body gets hotter, blood vessels open up. This leads to lower blood pressure and makes the heart work harder to push the blood around the body. This can cause mild symptoms such as an itchy heat rash or swollen feet as blood vessels become leaky. At the same time, sweating leads to the loss of fluids and salt and, crucially, the balance between them in the body changes. This, combined with the lowered blood pressure, can lead to heat exhaustion. Symptoms include: If blood pressure drops too far, the risk of heart attacks rises. Our bodies strive to keep a core temperature of about 37C whether we are in a snowstorm or a heatwave. It is the temperature at which our bodies have evolved to work. But as the weather gets hotter, the body has to work harder to keep its core temperature down. It opens more blood vessels near the skin to lose heat to our surroundings and starts sweating. As the sweat evaporates, it dramatically increases the heat lost from the skin. The UK Health Security Agency has some tips: Use thin sheets, cool your socks in the fridge before putting them on and stick to your usual bedtime routine, experts say. If they can be cooled down within half an hour, then heat exhaustion is not normally serious. NHS advice says: However, if they do not recover within 30 minutes, then what follows is heatstroke. It is a medical emergency and you should call 999. People with heatstroke may stop sweating even though they are too hot. Their temperature could go over 40C and they might have seizures or lose consciousness. Old age or some long-term conditions, such as heart disease, can leave people less able to cope with the strain heat puts on the body. Diabetes can make the body lose water more quickly and some complications of the disease can alter blood vessels and the ability to sweat. Children and those who are less mobile may also be more vulnerable. Brain diseases, such as dementia, can also leave people unaware of the heat or unable to do anything about it. People who are homeless will also be more exposed to the sun. Those living in top-floor flats will also face higher temperatures. Yes - but people should keep taking their medication as normal and need to make more effort to stay cool and hydrated. Diuretics - sometimes called ""water pills"" - increase the amount of water the body expels. They are taken widely, including for heart failure. In high temperatures, they increase the dangers of dehydration and imbalances in key minerals in the body. Antihypertensives - which lower blood pressure - can combine with the blood vessels that are dilating to cope with the heat and cause dangerous drops in blood pressure. Some drugs for epilepsy and Parkinson's can block sweating and make it harder for the body to cool itself. And other drugs such as lithium or statins can become more concentrated and problematic in the blood if there is too much fluid loss. There are about 2,000 deaths caused by high temperatures in England every year. Most of these will be heart attacks and strokes caused by the strain of trying to keep body temperatures stable. The higher death rate starts to kick in once the thermometer passes 25C-26C. However, the evidence suggests the deaths tend to be caused by higher temperatures in spring or early summer rather than ""peak summer"". This could be because we start to change our day-to-day behaviour as summer progresses and we get more used to dealing with the heat. The evidence from previous heatwaves is the increase in deaths happens very quickly - within the first 24 hours of the heatwave. Follow James on X (formerly Twitter)."
What do tenants want from the general election?,"Nicole is autistic, on benefits and has struggled to find a property. People dont necessarily see you as an attractive prospect. Your rental history is completely disregarded. Theres a stigma,"" they said. ""Brighton and Hove is an incredibly saturated rental market. We have incredibly high rents."" Nicole wants to see a ban on Section 21 evictions, rent controls and secure three or five-year tenancies as a standard. We need stable and secure housing, we need more housing, we need a landlords register,"" they added. The Renters (Reform) Bill, which would ban landlords from evicting tenants without a reason, expired with the shut down of parliament for the election. Labour, The Liberal Democrats and the Green Party said they would ban no-fault evictions, and build hundreds of thousands of new homes. The Conservatives and Reform UK have been approached for comment. Dipanjana Dey Dasgupta, 38, said her dream came true when she won a year-long scholarship at the University of Sussex. She and her six-year-old son arrived from India and are now living in Eastbourne because the cost of accommodation in Brighton, where the campus is based, is unaffordable for her. She said the 20-mile distance between her home and university was affecting her studies and she had missed many seminars - so she would like cheap, good accommodation for students near the university. A recent study by Canopy, which provides services for tenants and landlords, suggests that people in areas including Eastbourne, Brighton, Canterbury and Gillingham are spending a higher percentage of their salaries on rent than renters in London. Charlie Bainbridge, an estate agent in Canterbury, said high interest rates and unfavourable tax policies have resulted in fewer rental properties. He said: Weve seen a lot of private landlord properties being sold because of the lack of financial gain there is in running them as letting investments. That has a real impact on the availability and the supply and demand for tenants who are just trying to find sensible homes. Alistair Baldwin, who has 13 rental properties in Thanet, said most of the landlords he speaks to in his area would sell their investments if no-fault evictions were abolished. Instead, he wants to be able to offset mortgage interest against his income tax. He said : I would like to see some support in favour of landlords to make my portfolio go back as an investment rather than a liability."" Follow BBC Sussex on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

What does King Charles do and how has cancer changed his duties?,"The King temporarily stopped most of his public engagements after his diagnosis in February. The King's first visit was to a cancer treatment centre with Queen Camilla, and he also made a surprise visit to an army barracks in Hampshire, where he joked about being ""allowed out of my cage"". However, Charles will not undertake a full summer programme of engagements. He will attend Trooping the Colour on 15 June, but is expected to inspect soldiers from a carriage rather than on horseback. The King and Queen will also welcome the emperor and empress of Japan for a state visit from 25 to 27 June. The visit will go ahead, even though it takes place during the election campaign. Charles will deliver the King's Speech on 17 July as part of the State Opening of Parliament after the general election. Throughout his treatment, the King has held private meetings as head of state and completed official paperwork. Weekly meetings with Prime Minister Rishi Sunak also continued, although not all were in person. King Charles made his first major public appearance since his diagnosis on Easter Sunday, when he and the Queen greeted crowds after a church service in Windsor. The King is the UK head of state, but his powers are largely symbolic and ceremonial. He remains politically neutral. He receives daily dispatches from the government in a red leather box, including briefings ahead of important meetings, or documents needing his signature. The prime minister normally meets the King on a Wednesday at Buckingham Palace. These meetings are completely private, and no official records are kept of what is said. The King also has a number of official parliamentary roles: He also leads the annual Remembrance event in November at the Cenotaph in London. The King hosts visiting heads of state, and regularly meets foreign ambassadors and high commissioners. The King is also head of the Commonwealth, an association of 56 independent countries spanning 2.5 billion people. He is head of state for 14 of these, known as the Commonwealth realms, as well as the Crown dependencies - the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Charles also confers official honours on people from all walks of life, in public recognition of their merit, service or bravery. Most honours are awarded at new year and on the monarch's official birthday, in June. The King is also patron to a number of organisations, including the RNLI, the Samaritans, RAF Museum, the Yorkshire Agricultural Society, the Penny Brohn cancer charity and the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society, Orchestra, and Choir. The Queen also holds a number of patronages, including the Royal Literary Fund, the Royal Academy of Dance, the  Royal Voluntary Service and the Army Benevolent Fund, and undertakes her own public engagements. Camilla, William and Kate receive royal honours The order of succession sets out which member of the Royal Family takes over as monarch when the existing one dies or abdicates. First in line - the heir to the throne - is the monarch's eldest child. Sons no longer take precedence over their older sisters. King Charles's heir is his elder son, the Prince of Wales. William's eldest child Prince George is second-in-line to the throne, and his daughter Princess Charlotte is third. Her younger brother Prince Louis is fourth and Prince Harry is fifth. The Royal Family receives an annual payment from the taxpayer, known as the Sovereign Grant, which is used to pay for official expenses, such as the upkeep of properties and staff costs. The amount is based on a proportion of the profits of the Crown Estate, a £16.5bn property business owned by the monarch but run independently. The Sovereign Grant is worth £86.3m for 2023-2024, as it was in 2021-2022 and 2022-23, although the Royal Family's total spending was more, with the difference covered by reserves. To keep the annual payment at the same level of £86.3m in 2024-2025, the grant will be a smaller percentage of Crown Estate profits, which have been boosted by six new offshore wind farms. However, if Crown Estate profits continue to grow as predicted, even under the reduced formula, the amount given to the Royal Family is expected to increase substantially in 2025-2026 and 2026-2027. The King also receives money from a private estate called the Duchy of Lancaster, which is passed down from monarch to monarch. It covers more than 18,000 hectares of land, including property in central London. Worth £654m, it generates about £20m a year in profits. The Duke of Cornwall (currently William, Prince of Wales) benefits from the Duchy of Cornwall, which mainly owns land in the south-west of England. Worth £1bn, it generated a net surplus of £24m in 2022-23. The King and William receive the profits from the duchies personally, and can spend the money as they wish. Both voluntarily pay income tax on the proceeds. Some Royal Family members have private art, jewellery and stamp collections which they can sell or use to generate income as they wish. Charles became King on the death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, on 8 September 2022. On 6 May 2023, Charles and his wife Camilla were crowned by the Archbishop of Canterbury in front of more than 2,000 guests, including global politicians, fellow kings and queens, religious leaders, celebrities and community champions. Crowds lined the streets of central London to watch the King and Queen return to Buckingham Palace in a mile-long procession. Two months later, the King was presented with the Scottish crown jewels, in a special service of thanksgiving at St Giles' Cathedral, in Edinburgh. The King and Queen's official residence, Buckingham Palace, is undergoing a 10-year £369m refurbishment,. They split their time between Clarence House in London and Highgrove in Gloucestershire. Other Royal residences include Windsor Castle, Sandringham, in Norfolk, the Palace of Holyroodhouse, in Edinburgh, and Balmoral Castle, in Aberdeenshire. In August 2022, the Prince and Princess of Wales moved from Kensington Palace in west London to live in Adelaide Cottage, on the Windsor Estate. A 2023 YouGov opinion poll of more than 2,000 adults in Britain ahead of the first anniversary of Queen Elizabeth's death suggested a sharp generational divide. Overall, 62% wanted to keep the monarchy, with 26% backing an elected head of state - up from 17% a decade earlier. But while 80% of the over-65s supported the monarchy, only 37% of 18 to 24-year-olds agreed. There was also less support for the royals in Scotland or Wales than in England.

What is happening with postal votes?,"Postal voting has become much more commonplace in recent years, rising from 2% a couple of decades ago to 25% now. Anyone can apply for a postal vote with some people preferring to vote by post rather than do so in person. But there's a specific problem in this election. This is the first time a general election has been held in July since 1945 and most schools in Scotland have now broken up for the summer with many families flying off on holiday. If people are on holiday and have not yet got their ballot it basically means they will no longer be able to vote. The big issue seems to concern people who applied for a postal vote before the 19 June deadline but after 7 June. It appears that 7 June was a significant administrative deadline, although this was never publicised. Postal votes granted to people who applied up to 7 June have now been sent out all across Scotland. But in some council areas, postal votes granted after that date are only just being sent out. Voters who were planning to go away on holiday this weekend had no reason to believe that applying on 9 June rather than 7 June would have made any meaningful difference to the chance of their postal voting pack arriving on time. Some councils have identified the length of time it has taken to print postal voting packs as an issue. This means they have been sent out later than some might have hoped for. Royal Mail has strenuously denied that it is responsible for the problems. However, given the timescales, any example of a postal voting pack taking longer than normal to deliver could well have added to a voter's concerns. The short answer is no. It is now too late to arrange to vote by proxy. A postal vote cannot be completed by someone else. In theory, someone could fly back from holiday early and return their postal vote to their local polling place on Thursday but that is unlikely to be a practical or desirable option for many. From today, councils can start issuing replacement voting packs to people whose postal votes did not arrive. These packs can be sent out or collected in person. The City of Edinburgh Council has announced it is taking urgent steps to help people who will not be at home next week. It said people could go to the City Chambers on Friday and over the weekend with photo ID and a replacement pack can be issued. They will also be able to vote at a special polling booth over the next three days. The details of the re-issue arrangements vary from council to council. Council websites should have information. In some areas, only those who requested a postal vote before 7 June will be able request a replacement. This is because postal votes granted later are still being delivered. Those who applied after the 7th in those areas will have to wait. People request postal votes for all kinds of reasons - while some may be ill or housebound others may simply prefer to vote by post. If their postal pack arrives, too close to election day and people are worried about returning it on time there is a simple option. It can be handed in at a polling place on Thursday."
What to know about the Karen Read murder trial,"Before the case, Ms Read, 44, worked as an adjunct professor at Bentley University and an equity analyst at Fidelity Investments. She and Mr O'Keefe were together for about two years before his 2022 death, but the latter part of the pair's relationship was troubled, prosecutors said during their case. Mr O'Keefe spent 16 years with the Boston Police Department before his death. He was 46 when he died. Ms Read faces multiple charges, including second-degree murder, vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and leaving the scene of a collision resulting in death. If she is found guilty of second-degree murder, she could face a maximum sentence of life in prison under Massachusetts law. She has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Prosecutors allege the couple were drinking the evening before Mr O'Keefe's body was found. Ms Read allegedly dropped her boyfriend off at a house party. When leaving she made a three-point turn and struck Mr O'Keefe and then drove away, according to prosecutors. She returned to the party a few hours later with two other women and found Mr O'Keefe in a snowbank. His cause of death was later determined to be blunt force trauma to the head and hypothermia, NBC News reported. Throughout their case, prosecutors alleged the couple had a rocky relationship. They claim Ms Read intentionally struck her then-boyfriend with her car because of their relationship problems. Mr O'Keefe's brother, Paul O'Keefe, was among the people called to the stand who detailed the couple's disagreements. Ms Read did not take the stand as part of her defence. Instead, her lawyers argued that she was framed, and that investigators had inappropriate relationships with witnesses and others involved in the case. The defence claimed Mr O'Keefe was beaten inside the house party and later dragged outside where he was found. Much of the case they presented focused on what the defence called a poorly done investigation into O'Keefe's death by local law enforcement. Some of the investigators who oversaw the case knew the police officers who attended the house party that January night, the defence claimed. For example, the lead investigator, Massachusetts State Trooper Michael Proctor, admitted he was friends with the the Boston police office who hosted the party where  Mr O'Keefe died. Ms Read was a ""convenient outsider"" who was targeted to ensure investigators did not look at other suspects, the defence alleged. Among the witnesses who took the stand as part of the defence's case was a retired forensic pathologist, Dr Frank Sheridan. He claimed that Mr O'Keefe's body would have had more bruising if it were hit by a heavy vehicle, according to the Associated Press. After nine weeks of testimony and other legal proceedings, Ms Read's defence team and prosecutors began their closing statements on Tuesday. On Friday, the jury - who had been deliberating since Tuesday - sent a note to the judge saying they could not reach a unanimous verdict. In many cases, if jurors cannot reach an agreement, the judge asks them to return to the deliberation room and try again. This instruction is known as an Allen charge. That is exactly what Norfolk County Superior Court Judge Beverly Cannone told the Massachusetts jury on Friday. The 12-person jury - six men and six women - are now expected to return to their deliberations on Monday. Aidan Kearny, also known as ""Turtleboy"", is an intriguing character to have come out of this trial. He now faces charges for allegedly intimidating witnesses involved with the trial. Mr Kearny runs the website ""TB Daily News"" where he writes under the name ""Turtleboy"". He has asserted that Ms Read is innocent and has followed the case closely. His writing frequently questions the investigation into Mr O'Keefe's death and he often publicly confronts witnesses about the case. During the case, prosecutors shared several examples of witness intimidation with the jury. Mr Kearny was charged with witness intimidation in October 2023 and later pleaded not guilty. ""They will never shut me up, they will never, ever, ever stop me from reporting the truth about what happened to John O'Keefe,"" Mr Kearney told reporters after his 2023 arraignment. ""Reporting the news is not harassment. Asking questions is not harassment."" In December, he was indicted again. This time on 16 new charges that include witness intimidation and conspiracy to intimidate witnesses. Prosecutors alleged Mr Kearny and Ms Read were in communication and she was sharing information from the case that was not yet public. Judge Cannone, who is overseeing the case, ruled Mr Kearny would have to leave the courtroom when certain witnesses testified because of the witness intimidation charges brought against him. The trial of Karen Read, who is accused of murdering her boyfriend in January 2022, has garnered a massive internet following that has ultimately drawn massive crowds outside the courthouse. The jury tasked with rendering a verdict in the trial is now deliberating and could ultimately decide Ms Read's fate. The case surrounds Boston police officer John O'Keefe, who was found unresponsive in the snow outside a colleague's suburban home in January 2022 and later pronounced dead. His girlfriend, Ms Read, was charged in his murder - though she maintains her innocence. She faces multiple charges and is accused of dropping Mr O'Keefe off at a fellow police officer's home after a night of drinking, hitting him with her car and driving away from the scene.

What we learned from IT expert at Post Office inquiry,"Gareth Jenkins referred to Horizon's overall reliability throughout his testimony, even challenging findings from the landmark Bates v Post Office case that identified issues with the IT system. He acknowledged ""individual problems"" affecting specific branches but asserted that, as a whole, the system was ""working well"". When questioned about bugs, Mr Jenkins admitted lacking personal knowledge of all known issues, stating he typically became involved when drafted in for problem resolution. When pressed on how he could provide court evidence without full oversight of existing problems, Mr Jenkins said: ""Bugs impacting accounts were rare. Monitoring was in place, and fixes were prompt. Therefore, live system problems were rare, making me confident in its operation."" He claimed nobody from the Post Office alerted him to unknown issues, and he didn't actively seek information about bugs he wasn't involved in fixing. Mr Jenkins admitted not realising the need for comprehensive knowledge when giving evidence and ""with hindsight would have done things differently"". Mr Jenkins was an expert witness in several prosecutions brought by the Post Office. His duty was to the courts, not the Post Office or his employer Fujitsu. His role meant disclosing any relevant information about the Horizon software  even evidence that could help sub-postmasters' cases. Lawyers should have ensured that Mr Jenkins understood this. When asked about this by Mr Beer, Mr Jenkins stated that he didnt know about his responsibilities until the end of 2020. But Mr Beer showed him a letter from November 2005, written by lawyers working for the Post Office. The letter mentioned that he was an expert witness and, according to Mr Beer, listed his duties in an easy-to-understand way. After initially denying he had received it, Mr Jenkins later accepted that it was sent to him. He said he had no recollection of having been briefed on his duties and had clearly forgotten about having seen the letter. The former ""distinguished engineer"" faced intense questioning regarding remote access  the ability of Fujitsu staff to modify sub-postmaster branch accounts without their knowledge. In his 2010 witness statement for Seema Misra's trial, he stated: ""No external systems can manipulate branch accounts without user awareness and authorisation."" During the inquiry, Mr Jenkins accepted knowing that remote access was possible but believed it happened infrequently and left a visible trail. He based this view on ""informal chats"" with other Fujitsu IT staff. The former engineer told the inquiry that he only discovered the extent of unrestricted access Fujitsu technical staff had to sub-postmaster accounts during the 2018 High Court battle. In 2005, Mr Jenkins was asked to provide a draft witness statement in the case of sub-postmaster Noel Thomas. The Post Office wanted his thoughts on how the losses could have occurred. One possibility, he said, was some sort of system failure. But the Post Office demanded changes, saying the line was potentially very damaging"". It got deleted. The inquiry heard he was a willing actor in this process. He said he was happy with the changes he ended up with as it still accurately reflected what had happened but used less emotive words"". The Post Office was applying the pressure, but he never checked with his own Fujitsu lawyers about signing off evidence that had been toned down. Earlier he was asked to explain attempts to tweak his statements, but Mr Jenkins believed this was more of a tidying up to make them easier to read. He said he pushed back when the changes went too far. Four days of forensic questioning meant plenty of room for big revelations. It also meant Gareth Jenkins had nowhere to hide. It was very revealing about the character of the man who has been mentioned so many times at this inquiry. An IT specialist who spent his entire career at one company, by his own admission, he dealt better with systems than people. He would have been happiest engineering and designing, but found himself entangled in something very different. Something, he argues, he didn't fully understand. ""Can't you use the report I have already sent you?"" Mr Jenkins wrote to a Post Office lawyer in 2012. It is clear he was viewing the growing number of legal queries as a confusing frustration, taking him away from the tech front line. It is an annoyance that hasn't gone away. At one point, Mr Jenkins told the inquiry chair he wanted this ""over with"". Given the ongoing investigations, that seems unlikely. Reporting by Lorna Acquah, Nalini Sivathasan, Emma Simpson and Peter Ruddick The computer expert who helped build the faulty Horizon software has finally spoken under oath about his involvement in the Post Office scandal. Gareth Jenkins is a key figure, having appeared as an expert witness to defend Horizon in court cases, and is now at the centre of an alleged cover-up. His appearance at the inquiry was long-awaited after being postponed twice. He gave evidence over four days - the longest run of questions any witness has faced - and gave his version of events.

Wheelchair adventurer plans second Yr Wyddfa attempt,"He said the challenge aimed to raise greater awareness of accessibility issues faced by wheelchair users. ""We set out to show how inclusive design and engineering can make the world more accessible for everyone, everywhere,"" said Mr Wilson. ""I'm not ashamed to say [I cried] when the steering snapped. It was so frustratingly close. We know it can be done, we did over 85% unaided."" He said it would still have been possible to scale the mountain with help from his support team, but decided against continuing to try again and maintain the ""integrity"" of the challenge. Mr Wilson's climb was attempted in what he said was a ""first-of-its-kind"" engineered mobility chair, called RockClimber. The chair features four electric motors and is being repaired for the new attempt at climbing the peak. He said he hoped proving the capability of the chair could help drive future advancements in mobility chairs. Mr Wilson served in Northern Ireland, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan before he was forced to retire due to prolapsed discs in his spine. The mental health campaigner has filmed and published videos showcasing the difficulties he faces accessing day-to-day activities. He said: ""Mentally I'm a lot stronger [despite falling short in the first climb]. ""Six months ago, I would have been in a massive tailspin in a really dark place... but I'm not [now]. That's testament to me and the work I've done [to build inner strength]."" ""We're going to get to the summit and we're going to show people it can be done.""

When is A-level results day 2024 and what is Ucas clearing?,"AS and A-level results will be released on Thursday, 15 August. You can normally pick up your results in person anytime from 08:00 or you may receive an email, but check with your school or college, as arrangements can vary. Each exam is graded on a scale from A* to E. Grade boundaries show the minimum number of marks you need for each grade. They are decided by examiners and published on results day. Qualification Wales, which oversees Welsh exams, has said there is still a risk that performance in some subjects has not fully recovered since the pandemic. So, it will use statistics to help set the grade boundaries, to prevent marks dropping below 2019 levels. In England and Northern Ireland, the way boundaries are decided has returned to normal. Ucas's clearing process matches students with university and college courses that still have spaces, across the UK. Students can use it if they: Clearing opens on 5 July and closes on 21 October. Universities make an offer to join a course based on qualifications and grades or the Ucas tariff points system. Each A-level grade is worth a certain number of Ucas points. For example, an A* is worth 56 points and a D is worth 24 points. Many students decide not to go to university and start an apprenticeship or go straight into work. Others take a gap year so they have more time to decide what to do next. How can I appeal against A-level results? If you don't think your grade is right, you should talk to your school or college. It will contact the exam board on your behalf and ask for your marks to be reviewed. If you still think you have been unfairly graded after a review, you can ask your school or college to appeal. The exam board will consider whether a correction is needed. If you are still not satisfied, you can request a review from the exams regulator, Ofqual. The charity YoungMinds points out that exam results are not the only measure of success - and if things do not turn out how you had hoped, there are lots of ways to get where you want to. If you only just miss out on the grades you need to get on to a university or college course, the admissions office might accept you anyway, or offer you a place on a different course. It may also be possible to resit some or all of your exams. Talk to your school or college if you want to explore this route. Resits will take place in May or June 2025. Scotland has a different qualification system. Students take Highers, which are similar to A-levels. Results day in Scotland is Tuesday, 6 August."
When rockets go wrong  protecting the environment from catastrophe,"When SpaceX's Starship slowly hauled itself off the launchpad and into the Texas skies on 20 April 2023, few people expected the maiden flight of the world's most powerful rocket to last as long as it did. Applause broke out among the crowds lining nearby roads as Starship cleared the tower and its 33 engines blasted it into a cloudless sky. Then  three minutes and 57 seconds into its planned 90-minute flight  the spacecraft exploded, plunging back into the sea in a rain of debris. Engineers at SpaceX described the explosion as ""a rapid unscheduled disassembly""; SpaceX owner Elon Musk said it was ""exciting"". The mission was declared a success. It was certainly exciting and, from an engineering perspective, most definitely a success. Starship pushes the boundaries of rocket technology and, after its latest June 2024 flight, the spacecraft is considered by some to be well on its way to becoming a viable means of sending satellites, and one day people, into orbit and beyond to the Moon. But once the live coverage of the first flight had ended, engineers made a shocking discovery: the launch had not only destroyed the launcher but also the launchpad itself. SpaceX's launch site at Boca Chica is on the southern border of the United States, overlooking the Gulf of Mexico. The company launches to the east to gain the benefit of the Earth's rotation, with the added advantage that any rocket debris falls into the ocean (though what effect these rocket crashes have on the marine environment are largely unknown). The area is surrounded by state parks and national wildlife refuge lands  an important area for protected plants and migratory birds. When the engines on the launcher ignited, the pad was enveloped in a cloud of dust and smoke. This concealed an explosive plume of debris  the rocket burned a crater in the structure and sent sand, soil, chunks of metal and concrete flying through the air to land up to 10km (6.2 miles) away. Fortunately, no-one was injured but remote cameras captured some of the damage, local public radio reported ""ash"" falling on nearby communities and, later, that the surrounding conservation areas were strewn with wreckage. The fallout was officially documented by the government's US Fish and Wildlife Service and Starship was grounded. Before the launch, SpaceX had agreed to adhere to tight environmental conditions and had tested the launch pad with the rocket bolted down and the engines fired, but not at full thrust. In a post on X after the launch, Musk admitted that a ""massive water-cooled steel plate"" intended to go under the rocket at lift-off was not ready in time. The company has since rebuilt the launchpad to an improved design. But the explosion highlighted what appears to be a growing concern among environmental groups. With the number of objects launched into space growing every year  now reaching into the thousands  and with new launchers being developed, many environmental organisations are concerned about the unintended impact of rocket technology. Particularly when things go wrong. ""It's hard to watch these huge explosions,"" says Sarah Gaines Barmeyer, deputy vice president of conservation programmes at the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) in the US. ""The amount of environmental destruction they cause with the debris, and the potential for fires, air and water pollution  we would like to see more security and testing before we're launching spaceships near protected areas."" In the aftermath of the explosion at Boca Chica, several conservation groups filed a legal claim against government regulators for allowing the launch. The NPCA, meanwhile, is warning of the wider risk to seashore areas. It is currently campaigning against the development of a commercial launch site on the coast in the state of Georgia near a protected wilderness. The group is also among those concerned about expansion plans at Cape Canaveral in Florida. Famous as the base for Nasa launches, the US Department of the Air Force is currently assessing the environmental impact of building a new launchpad at Cape Canaveral for Starship, and has recently held a series of public meetings in the area to gauge local opinion. One of the proposed sites for the rocket would involve redeveloping an existing launchpad but the other  a potentially more controversial plan  would mean building an entirely new one nearer to the perimeter. ""These places are used to the impacts from the space industry,"" says Barmeyer. ""But what we're seeing right now with new proposals is that they're starting to get closer and closer to protected areas, and that's what we have concerns about."" The cape is surrounded by internationally important plants and wildlife, including the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge  one of the most biologically diverse areas in the world. ""[The cape] has approximately 1,133 species of plants, 141 species of fish, 74 amphibians and reptiles, 318 birds and 29 different mammals within its boundaries,"" says Don Dankert, who heads the environmental management team at Nasa's Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral. ""Twenty-one of these species are federally protected, such as manatees, sea turtles and American bald eagles."" Nasa has been monitoring the impacts of launches from the area for more than 40 years, beginning with the early flights of the Space Shuttle. In a statement, Nasa told the BBC that after 135 launches over a 30-year period, the primary impacts were ""the accumulation of aluminium particulates, damage to vegetation and temporarily reduced pH in adjacent waters"". Nasa attributes these effects to the propellant burned in the Shuttle's solid rocket boosters, and says similar results were recorded after the November 2022 launch of Artemis (which uses the same solid rocket technology). The agency says it also monitors water, air quality and that the ""acute impacts of space shuttle launches to wildlife populations were minimal"". ""All vehicles used in Nasa launches are tested extensively before they're allowed to depart,"" says Dankert. ""Part of that process is ensuring that environmental impacts from these launches are minimal and will not cause long-term damage to the ecosystem."" The same cannot be said for the Russian equivalent  the world's first spaceport at Baikonur in Kazakhstan. A cautionary tale of unregulated space ambition, vast areas of the flat steppe have been poisoned by carcinogenic fuel that spilled out of discarded rockets (you can read more about it here). It could, in fact, be argued that locating the Cape Canaveral launch complex where it is has actually helped to preserve the environment. Much of the nearby Florida coast has been overdeveloped with hotels, restaurants and apartments  the epitome of ""paving paradise to put up a parking lot"", as Joni Mitchell once sang  but because of security concerns and the risk of explosions, no-one can build too close to the launch site. Meanwhile, at Kourou in French Guiana, the European Space Agency (Esa) is preparing for the maiden launch of its own giant rocket, Ariane-6 (I wrote about the project here when I visited in 2018). The 650 sq km (251 sq mile) European spaceport is located just north of the equator, and is bordered by mangrove swamps and surrounded by tropical rainforest, home to a rich biodiversity of plants and animals including jaguars  the world's third-largest species of cat and considered a ""near threatened"" species. ""It's very well preserved,"" says Luce Fabreguettes, head of infrastructure for Esa's space transport directorate. ""[Within the spaceport perimeter] there is no farming, so no chemicals or pesticides, and hunting within the area is banned."" The spaceport is constantly monitored for air, soil and water quality with measures in place around buildings and infrastructure to protect wildlife. A recent solar farm, for instance, has been built with a fence that has holes for frogs to pass through. But, just as with Cape Canaveral, when it comes to the impact of launches, they have also recorded heightened levels of aluminium and acidity from the exhaust of solid rockets. ""There is very little impact, it's very transitory and only extends to around 500m (1,650ft) around the launch site,"" says Fabreguettes. The final assembly of the first Ariane 6 is taking place at the launchpad in preparation for a July launch. As Musk will doubtless testify, when it comes to maiden flights, failure is always an option. And veterans of the Esa launch programme will certainly be nervous. The first Ariane 5 rocket launched in June 1996 lasted just 39 seconds before exploding, the result of a software bug. While expectations remain high for the flight of its successor, mission planners have already worked through worst-cast scenarios. As well as only launching with a wind direction to carry debris out to sea, if the rocket disintegrates, it is designed to come apart in small pieces to minimise damage when they hit the ground. More like this:  The pollution caused by rocket launches  The giant rocket launcher in the jungle  Just how loud is a rocket launch? From the first images of our fragile blue green planet from space, to today's satellites that monitor our weather and changing climate, space has transformed our view of the Earth's environment. But unchecked development of spaceports or a rush to develop new launch systems without considering the impact of failure risk undermining that effort. Barmeyer is, nevertheless, optimistic: ""We do really believe that we can find a balance here and that the industry and conservation can exist side-by-side."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter  a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

Who should I vote for and what are the parties promising?,"A manifesto is the list of pledges parties make to voters, explaining what they would do if elected. This interactive has been put together by the BBC's Visual Journalism team, the BBC's political research unit in London and BBC journalists in Belfast, Cardiff and Glasgow. Its aim is to summarise where the parties stand on key topics to help voters make informed decisions at the ballot box. We have selected issues highlighted in polling company Ipsos Mori's Issues Index, a monthly survey that measures the things the public believe to be the most important facing the country. We analysed surveys from the twelve months before the election was called and selected the issues based on their aggregate score over that period. In some cases we have combined similar issues for simplicity. For example, ""NHS, hospitals, healthcare and social care"" are included under the one category of ""NHS and care"". ""Democracy"" was added as an issue on the editorial grounds that it help fulfil the BBC's public service commitments. In order for a party to be included in the guide it must be standing candidates in at least one sixth of seats in the nation it is campaigning in as well as meeting one of the following criteria: Parties are ordered by their vote share in the 2019 general election - and then alphabetically. You can see a full list of all parties standing at the general election here. This is an editorial process overseen by BBC journalists. All parties included in the guide have contacted by the BBC and given the opportunity to identify their key policies in each area. Because of devolution, the UK parliament cannot rule on, or has limited powers over, some of the issues highlighted in the guide. For example, ""health"" is devolved to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Parties do still campaign locally on these devolved issues in the run up to a general election. For this reason, the guide highlights issues that are devolved or partly devolved to acknowledge that these policies may not become law in that nation even if they are passed in Westminster. Produced by Chris Clayton, Dominic Bailey, Tom Finn, Claire Diamond, Luke Sproule, Chris Andrews, Adrian Browne, Tomos Livingstone, Dorian Morgan, Peter Barnes, Lauren Tavriger, Oscar Bentley, Beta Yee, Zoe Bartholomew, Matthew Taylor, Preeti Vaghela, Adam Allen, Scott Jarvis, Grace Richardson, Assiz Pereira, Holly Frampton and Mike Hills. The UK's main parties are announcing their campaign promises ahead of the general election on 4 July. Unsure who to vote for?

In some cases we have combined similar issues for simplicity. For example, ""NHS, hospitals, healthcare and social care"" are included under the one category of ""NHS and care"". ""Democracy"" was added as an issue on the editorial grounds that it help fulfil the BBC's public service commitments. In order for a party to be included in the guide it must be standing candidates in at least one sixth of seats in the nation it is campaigning in as well as meeting one of the following criteria: Parties are ordered by their vote share in the 2019 general election - and then alphabetically. You can see a full list of all parties standing at the general election here. This is an editorial process overseen by BBC journalists. All parties included in the guide have contacted by the BBC and given the opportunity to identify their key policies in each area. Because of devolution, the UK parliament cannot rule on, or has limited powers over, some of the issues highlighted in the guide. For example, ""health"" is devolved to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Parties do still campaign locally on these devolved issues in the run up to a general election. For this reason, the guide highlights issues that are devolved or partly devolved to acknowledge that these policies may not become law in that nation even if they are passed in Westminster.

Why cost of living is a key issue in Norwich South,"A writer and communications specialist, Mr Bennett, 26, is a former University of East Anglia student who has lived in Norwich for more than a decade. He said families were struggling  to cope with rising costs. The cost of living is just really, really biting people at that moment, he said. ""People are finding that their pay cheque just does not go far enough. An awful lot of people have been saying that they are now in a position where they are working to live and not really getting to do anything other than that, which is just completely unacceptable. Mr Burton, 42, works as a teacher and said he wanted to help families who were finding things tough. Being a teacher, I have seen so many walks of life struggling with economic problems and life issues, like the students, he said. Looking at the news and seeing these politicians on the TV that are just not being honest - they don't have the people's needs at heart. I think that one of the things is just to try to make people's lives a bit easier with  somebody honest in the role. Mr Lewis, 52, has been the Labour MP for Norwich South since 2015. He is hoping his work to tackle deprivation will persuade voters to back him again. Whether people say the NHS or climate or public services, the heart of the underlying picture is about the cost of living, he said. Its about people's ability to feel secure, their ability to feed their family. Their ability to heat their home and their ability to get to work on public transport. All of this is interconnected. That's a big thing that I've been talking about the past 10 years and will continue to talk about if I'm re elected. Mr Osborn, 30, is a Norwich city and county councillor for the Green Party. He said his party was focused on improving peoples lives. People are living with the escalating cost of living crisis, he said. There's more than a third of children in Norwich South living in poverty. Unfortunately, despite the fact that the Conservatives have led on that failure for the last 14 years, Labour aren't really offering any change. And that's why we are seeing people voting Green for real action and real change. David Thomas, 33, a former headteacher at the Jane Austen College in Norwich, is standing for the Conservatives. He said his work with students had inspired him. I'm trying to set out a vision of what I believe Norwich could be like, based on what I believe those children that I taught deserve, he said. ""And I think that the path for them having that prosperous future is one that comes best from Conservative governments. ""I think Conservative governments are ones that generate that prosperity that we need and that generate it mostly for the people who need it most. The most disadvantaged. Independent candidate Elizabeth Davey is also standing in Norwich South, as is Linda Law from the Party of Women. A full list of candidates can be found here.

"Why did Harry and Meghan leave the Royal Family, and where do they get their money?","Harry and Meghan met in 2016 and married in 2018. They stepped down as senior royals in January 2020. Angry about media intrusion, they were frustrated that Buckingham Palace stopped them developing their ""SussexRoyal"" brand. Harry remains a prince and is fifth in line to the throne. The couple kept their Duke and Duchess of Sussex titles, but are no longer addressed as his or her royal highness (HRH). Harry also gave up his military titles. When Harry's father Charles became King, the couple's two children became Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet of Sussex. Harry and Meghan moved to California in June 2020, saying they wanted space to raise Archie. Lilibet was born there in 2021. The couple no longer has an official UK residence. In early 2023, they were asked to vacate Frogmore Cottage, a Grade-II listed property on the Windsor estate. In April 2024, documents filed to Companies House listed the US as the country where Harry is usually resident, instead of the UK. The change was dated 29 June 2023, thought to be the date the couple formally left Frogmore Cottage. The conservative US think tank The Heritage Foundation has raised questions about Harry's immigration status because of his previous comments about taking cocaine, marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms. Drug use can block US visa applications. On 8 May, the duke attended a service at St Paul's Cathedral in London to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Invictus Games, the sporting competition for injured servicemen and women which he helped found. He did not see his father Charles or his brother William during his brief visit. In February, he flew back for a 45-minute meeting with Charles after Buckingham Palace announced that the King was being treated for cancer. The duke has also returned to London several times for his various court cases against newspaper publishers. Harry attended the King's coronation in May 2023 without Meghan. The duke and duchess both came back to the UK for the late Queen's Platinum Jubilee in June 2022, and her funeral in September of that year. As working royals, they received 95% of their annual income from Harry's father, then Prince of Wales. The taxpayer-funded Sovereign Grant made up the other 5%. When they stepped down as senior royals, King Charles gave them ""a substantial sum"" to help establish their new life. Harry and Meghan set up the Archewell charitable foundation, and entered into a number of commercial arrangements with private companies. In February 2024 the couple launched their Sussex.com website, which says they are ""shaping the future through business and philanthropy"". American Riviera Orchard In March 2024, Meghan launched what appeared to be a new lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard. Little is known about the new venture, but in April 2024, pictures of branded jam jars circulated on social media, suggesting it may sell food products. Television and podcasts The Sussexes' media company, Archewell Productions, makes programmes for Netflix, under a deal thought to be worth millions of dollars. In April 2024, Archewell said two new series were in production, one celebrating ""the joys of cooking & gardening, entertaining, and friendship"", and another exploring the world of professional polo. The couple previously featured in the Harry and Meghan documentary series, where they talked about life in the Royal Family, and The Heart of Invictus series, which discussed the duke's emotional ""unravelling"" after military service in Afghanistan. Archewell also made podcasts for Spotify under a contract thought to be worth $25m (£19.7m). The arrangement ended in June 2023. In February 2024, Meghan announced a new podcast deal with Lemonada Media. Books Harry's memoir, Spare, was published in January 2023. It discussed his relationship with his brother and father, as well as his grief over the death of his mother, Princess Diana. The book's publishers promised $1.5m (£1.18m) and £300,000 would be given to the Sentebale and WellChild charities. Meghan wrote a children's book called The Bench in 2021. Inheritance William and Harry received the bulk of Princess Diana's £13m fortune when she died in 1997. In an interview, Harry told Oprah Winfrey this money funded his family's move to the US. He is also thought to have inherited millions from his great-grandmother, the Queen Mother. It is not known whether the late Queen left him any money. Acting During her acting career, the Duchess of Sussex was reportedly paid $50,000 (£40,000) for each episode of the legal drama Suits. She appeared in more than 100 episodes. After stepping back from official duties, the duke and duchess were no longer afforded the security arrangements provided for senior royals. When Harry first left the UK, he said it would be too dangerous to bring his family back without adequate police protection and took the government to the High Court. Home Office lawyers said the duke would still have publicly-funded police security in the UK, under ""bespoke arrangements"". In late February 2024, the High Court ruled that the chosen approach ""was, and is, legally sound"". An earlier separate court ruling rejected the prince's request to be allowed to pay privately for more substantial protection. In April 2024, Harry's legal team said he would seek permission from the Court of Appeal to challenge the High Court decision. Harry settled a phone hacking claim against Mirror Group Newspapers in February 2024. His lawyer said the duke had been awarded ""substantial"" damages. He was also granted £140,600 in damages in another part of the case. A number of other court cases are continuing, including: In June 2024, a High Court judge ordered Harry to explain why messages which might be relevant to his legal case against the publisher of the Sun have been deleted."
Why some Glastonbury revellers will be alcohol-free,"Mr Illingworth originally stopped drinking before hernia surgery in February. Following the operation, he decided to continue with the new lifestyle, finding the ""positives outweighed the negatives"". ""It's possible to enjoy yourself without alcohol, which sounds obvious but my social life usually involved drinking alcohol in some way so there was always a worry that it was an essential element, but it isn't,"" he said. Non-alcoholic drinks have come a long way over recent years, if you want the taste of a nice cold lager you can still get that, but without the alcohol."" He also believes it will be easier for him to travel around the event as his rucksack will not be as heavy. ""I won't be carrying cans of beer, coke and a bottle of rum,"" he added. Despite giving up alcohol, Ms Vaggs still wants to enjoy going to festivals with friends. During her days in rehab, she believed she would never be able to dress up and attend festivals again, something she ""loved dearly"". But in 2023, she decided to try a festival sober. I said to myself 'if there is any doubt, any moment where I'm like, actually this is too much for me or I can't handle it, then I'm just going to leave and I'm going to go home and I'm not going to miss out and it's OK',"" she said. Then I went to Boomtown last year, and it was the best time, she added. The biggest difference is waking up the next morning and being like 'Im ready to go again'.

A music festival without alcohol might be unimaginable to some, but others enjoying the Glastonbury experience this weekend plan to avoid it altogether. Apart from the health benefits, a number of festival-goers say they are choosing to forego a drink so they can wake up without a hangover and enjoy more of the event. Garry Illingworth, 54, from Hampshire, believes he will have more energy and will see more acts rather than just hanging out and having a drink. Meanwhile, Chloe Vaggs, of Bristol, has experienced the dangers of drinking. The 25-year-old said: It got really bad - I became very dependent on it. I came to the decision that I had no option - I either got sober or chose to die. Mr Illingworth originally stopped drinking before hernia surgery in February.

Why the EU might be about to make Chinese electric cars more expensive,"With China accused of selling electric cars at artificially low prices, the European Union is widely expected to hit them with tariffs this week. The BYD Seagull is a tiny, cheap, neatly styled electric vehicle (EV). An urban runabout that wont break any speed records, but nor will it break the bank. In China, it has a starting price of 69,800 yuan ($9,600; £7,500). If it comes to Europe, it is expected to cost at least double that figure due to safety regulations. But that would still be, by electric car standards, very cheap. For European manufacturers that is a worrying prospect. They fear the little Seagull will become an invasive species, one of a number of Chinese-built models poised to colonise their own markets at the expense of indigenous vehicles. Chinas domestic auto industry has grown rapidly over the past two decades. Its development, along with that of the battery sector, was a major component of the Made In China 2025 strategy, a 10-year industrial policy launched by the Communist Party in Beijing in 2015. The result has been the breakneck development of companies like BYD, now vying with Tesla for the title of the worlds biggest manufacturer of electric vehicles. Established giants such as SAIC, the owner of the MG brand, and Volvos owner Geely, have also become big players in the EV market. Last year, more than eight million electric vehicles were sold in China  about 60% of the global total, according to the International Energy Agencys annual Global EV Outlook. For policymakers in Europe and the US, however, this is a cause for concern. With Chinese brands having plenty of surplus capacity and moving into international markets, they fear their own companies will be unable to compete. They claim hefty subsidies for domestic production allow Chinese firms to keep prices at a level other firms will struggle to match. According to a report by the Swiss bank UBS, published in September, the Chinese advantage is real. It suggested that BYD could produce cars at some 25% lower cost than the best of the legacy global carmakers. It said BYD and other Chinese firms were set to conquer the world market with high-tech, low-cost EVs for the masses. Meanwhile, earlier this year, the Alliance for American Manufacturing warned that the introduction of cheap Chinese cars  could be an extinction-level event for the US auto industry. It called for a dedicated and concerted effort to turn those imports back, concluding that there was no time to lose. Last month, the US took decisive action. The Biden administration raised its tariff on imports of Chinese battery-powered cars from 25% to 100%. Sales of Chinese-made EVs in the US are currently negligible; with the new tariffs, they are likely to stay that way. The move was part of a wider package of measures targeting imports from China that has been condemned by Beijing as ""naked protectionism"". At the same time, the US is subsidising its own car industry, through tax incentives that make domestically-produced vehicles cheaper to buy. The EU appears to be taking a more moderate approach, despite tough rhetoric. In her state of the Union address in September last year, the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced an investigation into Chinese imports. Global markets are now flooded with cheaper Chinese electric cars,"" she said. Their price is kept artificially low by huge state subsidies. This is distorting our market. The initial results of that investigation are now imminent. It is widely expected that the Commission will provisionally raise duties on EVs imported from China, from the standard level of 10% for third country imports to between 20 and 25%. According to Matthias Schmidt of Schmidt Automotive Research, this would be a rather more proportionate response than the US move. The 100% tariff is just pure protectionism, regressive and stifles innovation, and prevents a competitive landscape for the consumer,"" he says. If the EU imposes tariffs of no more than 25%, it will be more about levelling the playing field, and evening out the 30% cost advantage Chinese manufacturers have."" Nevertheless, tariffs could hurt European companies as well as helping them. Firstly, they would not just affect Chinese brands. For example, BMWs iX3 electric SUV is built at a factory in Dadong and exported to Europe. The company also intends to import large quantities of Chinese-made electric Minis. Both models would be subject to the tariffs, leaving the manufacturer to absorb the extra cost, or raise prices. The US manufacturer Tesla would also be affected, as it builds cars in Shanghai for export to Europe. Secondly, although European makers have invested heavily in production in China in recent years, in partnership with local manufacturers, a number of them still export high-value models to Chinese markets. If China wanted to retaliate by imposing its own hefty tariffs, these shipments could be targeted. Small wonder then, that executives at European carmakers have been distinctly lukewarm about the EUs initiative. Earlier this year, Volkswagen Groups chief executive Oliver Blume warned that the introduction of tariffs was potentially dangerous, because of the risk of retaliation. Last month BMW boss Oliver Zipse told investors you could very quickly shoot yourself in the foot by engaging in trade battles, adding we dont think that our industry needs protection. Ola Källenius, chief executive of Mercedes-Benz has gone a step further, publicly calling for tariffs on Chinese EV imports to be lowered rather than raised, to encourage European companies to do a better job. Support for the EU investigation has largely come from France. Yet even among French manufacturers, there is doubt as to whether tariffs are the correct approach. Carlos Tavares, head of the Stellantis group which includes Peugeot, Citroen, Vauxhall/Opel and DS, has described them as a major trap for countries that go down that path. He has warned that European carmakers are in a ""Darwinian"" struggle with their Chinese rivals, something that is likely to have social consequences as they pare back costs in an effort to compete. Renaults chief executive Luca de Meo, meanwhile, says we are not in favour of protectionism, but competition must be fair. He has called for the adoption of a strong European industrial policy to promote the sector, taking inspiration from policies launched by the US and China  in an effort to compete with both. Meanwhile, the UK is looking on with interest. The head of the countrys trade watchdog, the Trade Remedies Authority, has previously made it clear he would be ready to set up an investigation into Chinese EVs, if ministers or the industry wanted it. So far it is understood no such request has been made. Ultimately, as a deeply political issue, it will be something for the next government to address, after the election. What higher tariffs may give Europe is more time for both car manufacturers and policymakers to adapt to the challenge from China. But many within the industry acknowledge that if Europe is to remain a major player in the global automotive sector, it will have to do much more than simply set up barricades at home."
Wildfires ravaging Arctic Circle - EU monitor,"According to estimates from Copernicus' findings, carbon emissions from the wildfires throughout June were the third highest for the past two decades at 6.8 mega tonnes of carbon - only behind fires in 2020 and 2019. Carbon emissions in the those years were 16.3 and 13.8 mega tonnes, respectively. Mark Parrington, senior scientist at CAMS, said conditions leading to the latest bout of fires were similar to those present during the 2019 and 2020 fires. In 2021, wildfires also swept Sakha but they were less intense than the 2020 and 2019 fires. Separately, Arctic sea-ice has been declining rapidly since the 1980s."

Ms Drydale said she had collected wild seeds to ensure native plants did not die out  and continued to be grown in Jerseys fields and hedgerows.

Wildlife trust seeks to buy long sought-after land,"Ms Routledge said there has long been a desire for development on the fields. A planning application for housing last went to the local authority in 2018, she said. If any plans were approved, they would be ""really detrimental"" to the reserve where more than 200 bird species have been recorded, Ms Routledge added. Housing developments nearby would mean more house cats nearby, she said. ""This would have a significant detrimental impact on ground nesting birds."" The wildlife trust has an October deadline to unlock cash from the Landfill Communities Fund. The fields themselves cost £540,000 and the charity needs to raise 10% of this itself in order to access the rest. It launched its campaign on Thursday after sending donation letters to its members and has already raised more than £11,000.

Wolves sell out season tickets after price u-turn,"The club had announced a series of price increases for the 2024-25 season, with some tickets up 17% and one category of under-14s tickets up 176% from £105 to £290. Club chairman Jeff Shi said that commercial growth was vital for the football club's sustainability and competitiveness. Wolves also said it had carried out a review which showed its adult prices were lower than most, while junior prices were among the lowest in the league. Following the price rise u-turn, Darren Warren from the Wolves 1877 Trust said he had ""a lot more respect for the people who made the decision"".

Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.uk Wolverhampton Wanderers have announced they have sold their allocation of season tickets, following protests over proposed price rises. Earlier this month the club agreed to scrap ticket increases for under-14s and freeze the cost of adult season tickets after a fan backlash. A petition against the plans attracted more than 15,000 signatures, with supporters' groups urging the club to reconsider. It had argued the increased prices were crucial to help it ""to align more closely with comparable clubs"" and to compete at the highest level.

Woman barred from plane over 'slight' passport mark,"A south London woman was barred from her TUI flight because staff feared a ""slight mark"" on her passport would see her turned away by Mexican border control. Laila March, 25, from Croydon, was forced to shell out £1,200 for a British Airways flight after she was blocked from boarding her original TUI plane at Gatwick Airport on 7 June. She was told she could not board the plane because her passport was damaged  even though she had just flown back from Morocco the day before. Ms March has since been told TUI will refund the cost of the BA ticket. ""I think its just insane that TUI can say my passport is damaged and not allow me to board for fear Im not going to be allowed into Mexico by passport control, and then for another airline to have no issue with the same passport, let me fly to Mexico and then I get through passport control,"" Ms March said. ""It was a very small mark, almost like a little scratch on the right hand side of the page but you would have to look very carefully to see it  I hadnt even noticed until they pointed it out."" The UK Passport Offices website states that a passport is considered damaged if ""you cannot read any of your details, any of the pages are ripped, cut or missing, there are holes, cuts or rips in the cover, the cover is coming away or there are stains on the pages, for example ink or water damage"". Ms March raised a complaint with TUI in the hope of getting a full or partial refund for her BA flight, which cost more than the holiday. She was told TUI would investigate the matter, but on 16 June she received an email that said her case had been closed. On 21 June, she received another message to say the company would be refunding the cost of the BA ticket in the next two weeks. Ms March has now applied for a new passport over fears she will be turned away by TUI again for her trip to Jamaica in September. ""This whole experience with TUI has just left a sour taste in my mouth and I just want to avoid it happening again,"" she said. A spokesperson for TUI UK & I said: ""Were sorry to hear Ms March was unable to travel with TUI as planned due to the damage on her passport. ""Customers are informed by email, and on our website, at the time of booking and prior to travel that UK Governments passport requirements must be followed. ""We strongly advise that customers check their passports are damage free as if there is any concern a passenger could be denied entry to their destination, they will be denied travel at the discretion of our check-in team.""

"Woman claimed to serve in Afghanistan, court hears","The jury at Cardiff Crown Court heard transcripts of interviews with NHS investigators following her arrest in April 2021. Ms Nasir, who was a Band 7 ward manager at the neonatal ward in the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, was suspended after four months following concerns about her CV in February 2020. An internal investigation began but the hospital was told she could not attend a planned hearing. She told hospital managers at the time of the meeting she would be away in the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia, a British Island territory for an Army Reserves annual training camp. But in a later interview with investigators, she said the training camp was cancelled because of Covid. She resigned two days before a disciplinary hearing in November 2020. nan Earlier in the trial, the court heard Ms Nasir was not a member of the Army or the Army Reserves. She tried to join in 2010 and 2015, but was unsuccessful. When asked for her military service number, Ms Nasir, who claimed to have served for 16 years and retired with the rank of Captain, initially told investigators: ""I can't remember it off the top of my head."" The Army confirmed she had been an adult volunteer with the Army Cadets, but she had never been deployed overseas. Ms Nasir told Beverley Jones, local counter fraud specialist investigator for Swansea Bay Health Board, that she served in a field hospital in Helmand Province ""north of Camp Bastion"" and used her annual leave to serve. When asked by Mrs Jones for details of her military career, she said: ""Why, what has that to do with my NHS? ""I'm not comfortable with answering questions about my military... a lot of people get into trouble."" Later, Ms Nasir explained she could in fact remember her service number, and told Mrs Jones it came under the Army Cadets. In a second interview in June 2021 with Neil Jones, the senior local counter fraud investigator for Swansea Bay Health Board, Ms Nasir said she had been deployed in Kosovo as an Army Reserve volunteer. Challenging her, Mr Jones said: ""You were never an Army volunteer - there is no such thing - is that correct? The court heard Ms Nasir disagreed. Mr Jones asked her where she flew to Kosovo from, which unit she was assigned to, who her Commanding Officer was and how long she was deployed for. To which she replied to each question: ""I don't know."" Ms Nasir also claimed to have been deployed to Sudan in 2006, where she claimed to have served with 7 Rifles, but she could not remember which platoon she had been attached to. In 2008 she said she had been deployed to Iraq and the southern city of Basra as what she described as a ""volunteer with the Ministry of Defence"". Ms Nasir had a daughter who would have been two or three years old in 2001. Mr Jones asked her who looked after the little girl during her deployment. She said: ""Who looked after my daughter? Probably someone I trust."" Pressed by Mr Jones, she said the child was cared for by her former partner. He challenged her again on her claim that she was deployed in Afghanistan in 2010. Ms Nasir said: ""It was part of the Salvation Army, that's all I have to say."" She told the court she was based one and half hour outside Helmand.

Woman critically injured in ride 'malfunction',"A woman in her 40s is in hospital with life-threatening injuries after a funfair ride malfunctioned at a country show in south London, the Met Police has said. The incident happened during Lambeth Country Show in Brockwell Park at about 18:20 BST on Saturday. A man in his 40s is also being treated for ""potentially life-threatening injuries"", the force said. Lambeth Council said the investigation would ""determine the cause of the malfunction"". Two other people, a man in his 50s and an 11-year-old girl, were injured in the incident and have since been discharged from hospital, the Met said. The problem occurred during the first day of the free event. Funfair rides at the show were closed on Sunday, the council added. One of the fairground rides was seen covered in tarpaulin on Sunday morning, although it was not clear which ride had malfunctioned. The council said emergency services had arrived at the scene shortly after the incident and the funfair had been closed. Officers attended the scene on Sunday alongside the Health and Safety Executive. The force said that ""inquiries continue to establish the full circumstances"". Additional safety checks were being carried out on all rides and attractions at the show, Lambeth Council said. A spokesperson for the council added their thoughts were with the four people injured on the ride. We thank the emergency services for their swift response and for the support they are providing to the affected families,"" they said. ""The safety and well-being of our attendees remains our top priority, and we are committed to providing a secure and enjoyable experience for all visitors. The show continued from 13:00 BST on Sunday but with all fairground rides shut and cordoned off. Signs that said ""apologies for any inconvenience, this ride will not open today"" were pinned to wire fencing circling the fairground area. Visitors of all ages were seen reading the signs and talking to a fairground worker, who told them all the rides are shut. Brockwell Park is a popular green space located near Brixton. The incident fell on the 50th anniversary of the Lambeth Country Show, which is one of the ""biggest free family festivals in the UK"", according to its website. A spokesperson for London Ambulance Service said four crews were deployed along with members of its hazardous area response team and an air ambulance. All four people injured were taken to ""major trauma centres"", they added. Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Woman used nurses' emails to fake references - court,"Ms Nasir claimed Ms Westphal was a senior nurse and her line manager at the neonatal unit at Hillingdon Hospital in London in June 2019. But the court also heard Ms Westphal left Hillingdon Hospital in October 2018 and had no further access to her hospital email account. Neither was she Ms Nasir's line manager or as senior as had been stated. NHS counter fraud investigators Beverley Jones and Neil Jones interviewed Ms Nasir following her arrest in Brecon, Powys, in 2021. In transcripts read to the jury they told Ms Nasir: ""[Ms Westphal] quite categorically never provided you with a reference and at no time did she provide you with any details."" Mr Jones added Ms Nasir had instead simply ""accessed her email and sent in through to (NHS job portal) Tracs"". Ms Nasir replied: ""That is not true, I did not do that."" The court was told Ms Nasir, unbeknown to the person concerned, also accessed the email account of another nurse to provide a reference for herself while applying for the role of senior nurse at Hillingdon Hospital in 2015. However, Ms Nasir insisted to investigators that person had been ""happy to put me down as referee"". In addition, the court heard she failed to declare her criminal record when applying for the Hillingdon job, Ms Nasir having been convicted of four counts of benefit fraud in October 2010. She was fined and given a community-based work order but claimed to have been the victim of an administrative misunderstanding about council tax payments. Ms Nasir has also claimed to have taught at the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst, was an air traffic controller at Luton Airport as part of a work placement to do with her physics studies. When challenged about this by an investigator she replied: ""I have the essential qualifications for the jobs."" Her other claims include having served with the Army army in locations such as Syria and Haiti, where she claimed she was ""solely responsible for the covert and safe extraction of VIP military personnel from danger zones"".

Women and children moved out of town's only refuge,"BCP Council said none of the women or their families would be made homeless by the closure. A spokesperson said: ""The lack of self-contained accommodation and communal indoor space make the refuge unsuitable to continue to provide safe accommodation. ""Of the 18 families residing at the refuge, 10 have already moved to alternative safe accommodation or have agreed dates for planned moves. ""The remaining eight are being supported to move on to alternative housing in the next seven weeks."" Lucy Hadley, head of policy at Womens Aid, said: ""We know from our work with survivors that the peer support women give each other within a refuge is an essential part of the service, supporting them to recover and start rebuilding their lives. ""We are also deeply concerned to read the reports of trauma and fear that women and children living in the Bournemouth Womens Refuge are facing at the prospect of being evicted in July, with nowhere to go."" The petition, launched by Julie Dinmore, says the closure would ""leave countless women and children without a safe haven"". ""We cannot allow this vital service to be shut down,"" she said.

Worker 'accessed child service data' without approval,"""The councils childrens services case management system was accessed by an individual who is no longer employed by the council,"" a spokesperson for the Labour-led authority said.

Workers at black cab plant to strike over pay,"About 100 workers at a black cab manufacturer are set to strike in a pay dispute, a union has said. Unite the union said its members at the London Electric Vehicle Company (LEVC) in Ansty Park, Coventry, have rejected a 3.5 % pay rise and £400 one-off payment for those on lower grades. The firm, which has made thousands of London's electric licensed taxis, is owned by Geely Holding. LEVC said it had since made a ""competitive updated offer"" amounting to an equivalent total of a 5.9% pay rise"" from an earlier offer of 5.2%, adding it was committed to finding a satisfactory solution for both parties. Workers, who have seen ""wages fall by 19.9% in real terms"" since 2016, will take an initial day of action on Thursday, followed by an overtime ban, the union added. added. Further strike dates are expected to be called if the dispute is not resolved. Unite said the pay offer was a ""real terms pay cut"" as the real rate of inflation (RPI) was 4.9% when the increase was to be implemented in January. It followed ""years of below inflation pay rises"", while Geely had made profits of £584m last year, the union said. LEVC, which said the Ansty plant had about 400 employees, said it was disappointed Unite members had voted for industrial action following pay negotiations and had updated its pay offer. ""Against the context of external challenges and significant financial pressures, LEVC has made a competitive updated offer, amounting to an equivalent total of 5.9% pay rise in 2024 for our operators,"" its statement said. We are committed to reaching a satisfactory solution for both parties. ""Should industrial action take place we have put in several measures to ensure that the impact, if any, upon our production schedule and ultimately our customers will be minimal. Follow BBC Coventry & Warwickshire on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Writer puts disabled children centre stage,"A writer hopes to inspire disabled and working-class children to follow in her footsteps and ""do whatever their hearts desire"". Lisette Auton is about to publish her third children's book, and like her others, Lights Out features a young, disabled protagonist. The disabled Darlington author said it was important for children of similar backgrounds to see themselves represented on bookshelves. ""When I was growing up, there weren't many decent disabled characters, they were all stories of pity or they got left behind during adventures, or magically fixed. I think that's rubbish,"" she said. ""It's really important to me that disabled children see themselves in books, in proper bookshops, because that's what I needed to see and I didn't growing up. ""An author is not something I knew I could be when I was a child and I'd love others to know they can be who they want to be."" Most of Ms Autons stories are set in the North East, with Lights Out based in Darlingtons haunted Hippodrome theatre, the history of which inspired her ghostly tale. The main character is Hetty, who zooms about in a mobility scooter and is the latest example of the author's commitment to representing disabled children. She hopes her books inspire youngsters to follow their dreams, and in a message to readers, said: ""If youre like me and youre a secret scribbler and you love writing but dont know what to do with the words, ask your teachers, ask your librarians about how to write books. ""We need more of you from little towns like Darlington, we need more of our stories on the shelves to show that these jobs are possible."" Ms Auton was discovered after being mentored by Writers Block North East and winning a competition held by publishers Puffin. She was recently named a Tees Valley Artist of the Year. ""Its still very much 'pinch me',"" she said. ""I cant believe my job is making things up, its just a bit blooming brilliant, isnt it?""

"Your Voice, Your Vote: 'We need Covid drug on NHS'","Mrs Brigden has been campaigning after her husband, Scott Brigden, was diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, in June 2021. He received various chemotherapy treatments and a stem cell transplant four months later. One of the treatments he was receiving prevented him from forming an antibody response to normal Covid vaccines. As a result, the couple had been shielding until November 2022, when Mr Brigden had his first Evusheld injection. He pays £1,500 each time he receives the dose every six months. Evusheld, developed by AstraZeneca, contains two antibodies against Covid that boost protection for those whose immune systems do not respond well to vaccines. It was approved by the UK regulator, the Medicines Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA), in March 2022. However, five months later the government decided not to buy the medicine. In February 2023, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) concluded against recommending Evusheld ""because there is not enough evidence of its effectiveness against current variants and those likely to be circulating in the next six months"". Mrs Brigden, a chartered surveyor, said they were ""very fortunate"" in affording to pay for the treatment privately, but there were hundreds of thousands who were not in the same position. ""For most people the pandemic is over, but for this group it isn't,"" she said. ""A lot of these people have fought through really bad cancer outcomes and are struggling to live day-to-day. To then add the isolation of having to shield, the toll on the mental health of these people is unbelievable. ""We have some really heartbreaking situations. So it is something that really needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency."" The 54-year-old said it had been ""really frustrating"" living in isolation, but the injections had allowed a relatively normal life to resume. Her husband still takes precautions, such as wearing a mask in certain environments. Mrs Brigden said she wanted the next government to ""prioritise"" making Evusheld available on the NHS, as well as providing support to the immunosuppressed population. The Lib Dems pledged to ""develop and implement a post-pandemic strategy"" for supporting people who are immunocompromised. People with blood cancer, vasculitis, kidney transplants, multiple sclerosis, long- term conditions and rare diseases and those on immunosuppressant drugs are crying out for the preventive drug Evusheld."" The Green Party said: ""We acknowledge that NHS budgets need to grow to cover the increasing demands of a growing and ageing population, alongside improved treatment options. ""Offering treatments through the NHS for people with weakened immune systems will form part of our commitment that everybody has access to the healthcare they need, when they need it.""

"Your Voice, Your Vote: Abolish Tamar Bridge toll","Candidates standing in the constituency of South East Cornwall were asked to respond to Ms Eastlake's suggestion in a BBC hustings on Thursday.

""If I am elected on 4 July, I already have sitting on my desk in Westminster the layout of a private members bill to actually try to change the Tamar Bridge Act to abolish both the tolls on the bridge and ferry,"" she said.

A single mum of two children with autism has called for more funding to help young disabled people. Tracey Barnes, 50, who lives in Camborne, Cornwall, has criticised the lack of respite centres which provide short-term relief for primary caregivers. She is among many people who have got in touch with the BBC via Your Voice, Your Vote to tell us special educational needs and disabilities (Send) was the most important issue for them in this election. Ms Barnes uses the centres for her non-verbal daughter who struggles to sleep. During the pandemic, Ms Barnes was left ""severely sleep deprived"" as she could not access the service for her daughter. ""Everything I thought, everything I did, everything I breathed was to do with supporting my family members,"" said Ms Barnes. A mum from Plympton, Devon, whose 11-year-old son has autism, said he struggles in a ""mainstream classroom"". Katie Rich, 50, said: ""He has difficulties processing verbal information so in a busy classroom even having a conversation at a steady level - he finds that really, really hard."" Ms Rich, a former teacher, said her son also struggles with anxiety if things are not ""scaffolded"" for him which can lead to him feeling ""physically sick"".

"Your Voice, Your Vote: More help needed for mental health","I just felt like I'd let everybody down, that I'd failed, that I wasn't good enough, that I would be better off not here any more. Father-of-two Simon is determined to speak openly and honestly about what happened to him - even if it is extremely difficult. The 46-year-old works for a food and drink manufacturer and lives in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, with his wife and teenage daughter. In November last year, Simon was diagnosed with depression and tried to take his own life. He is among the many people who got in touch with the BBC via Your Voice, Your Vote to tell us that mental health is the most important issue for them during this election. Last year, Simon's mental health was suffering due to pressures at work and home. He was on the waiting list for an autism assessment - which still has not happened. I tried to avoid just getting up in the morning. It just felt like I couldn't face the day. I just didn't want to do anything, Simon reveals. He lost two stones in weight and didnt sleep for weeks and weeks and weeks. One night, things just came to a head and if it wasn't for my wife and daughter, I could have done something quite serious, he says. They locked me in the house thankfully, and I ended up going to hospital to A&E. But a week later, Simon left his home and tried to take his own life. He was helped by his local mental health crisis team and ended up being off work for nine weeks to recover. Simon says even though hes not there yet in his recovery, that overall he is doing fantastically well. But he believes he would have benefited from earlier in-person intervention. If I had the face-to-face support before, then I probably wouldn't have had the issues that I had in November, he says. I think some of the services are good, however, I just don't think there are enough of them. Simon now wants to see greater investment in mental health services and for the parties to prioritise mental health this election. It's breaking people's families. It's breaking people's lives unnecessarily. It almost broke mine, and that is not OK, he says. Recent polling from the charity Mind suggests nearly half of people (49%) think mental health support through the NHS is difficult to access. Of those who responded, nearly two-thirds (66%) were concerned about the state of mental health services provided by the NHS. A National Audit Office report found that there were an estimated 1.2 million people on the waiting list for community-based NHS mental health services at the end of June 2022. Rosie Weatherley, spokesperson for Mind, says its very, very urgent that whoever comes into the next government prioritises mental health. Simon believes that his struggles were made worse because he is a man. He says there is often a sense among men that they need to man up, grow up"". ""It's something that people don't want to talk about because they see it as a sign of weakness, he says. Suicide is the biggest killer of men under the age of 50 and three-quarters of suicides registered in 2022  - the most recent year where data is available - were males. Simon is now part of Andys Man Club, a men's suicide prevention charity. He says its helped massively to talk to other men who have gone through similar experiences. He now volunteers with the charity too. Nobody should take their own life because that's a permanent decision that you can't take back, he says. Feeling depressed is a temporary thing, but taking your own life is a permanent one."" The Conservatives say their suicide prevention strategy will ensure employers in largely male industries have appropriate support in place for employees, such as mental health first aiders, and they will expand mental health programmes, including NHS Talking Therapies, over the next parliament. Labour says it will recruit 8,500 mental health professionals to cut mental health waiting lists, provide mental health support in every school, and open walk-in hubs in every community so young men and boys are not left to suffer alone. The Liberal Democrats are calling for the introduction of regular mental health check-ups. They also say they will put a qualified mental health professional in every school. The Green Party says it will ensure that everyone who needs it can access evidence-based mental health therapies within 28 days. It says it will also provide a trained and paid counsellor in every primary and secondary school, and every sixth-form college. Plaid Cymru says it supports reform of the Mental Health Act. It says reform is well overdue. It also says that alongside the transfer of full powers over. The BBC approached the Scottish National Party and Reform UK, but they did not respond. In its manifesto, the SNP called for the next UK government to boost NHS spending by £10bn a year, with £1.6bn of that coming to Scotland, while Reform pledged an extra £17bn a year for the NHS.

"Your Voice, Your Vote: Scrap VAT on bio fuels","The government said using HVO could eliminate up to 90% of net carbon dioxide (CO2) by significantly reducing nitrogen oxide, particulate matter and carbon monoxide emissions. Mr Inglis said he did not have access to mains gas due to the rural setting of his home and was reliant on solar panels and his oil fire burner, which he said was coming to the end of its life. He is now looking to spend £500 to convert his existing boiler to run on HVO, which he said was substantially cheaper than heat pump alternatives. ""It offers a good solution, it is not adding to global warming and it is a good solution to particular properties,"" he said. Labour's South East Cornwall candidate Anna Gelderd said she would meet with Mr Inglis to understand the proposal. ""A Labour government will make people better off, implement an energy transition by setting up GB Energy and put fiscal responsibility at the heart of our plan for the country,"" she said. The Conservative candidate for South East Cornwall Sheryll Murray said: ""I am happy to look at VAT because clearly, I have met lots of struggling families in South East Cornwall and I know how hard it is for people when they do not have mains gas or any alternative to oil."" Liberal Democrat candidate for South East Cornwall Colin Martin acknowledged fuel prices had always been a problem for rural households. He said HVO was not a long-term solution but it ""could be a good transition fuel"" and reducing VAT on bio fuels ""could be a good way forward"".

A man from Cornwall is calling for the next government to back greener fuels by removing VAT. Steve Inglis, who lives near Liskeard in the constituency of South East Cornwall, said he wanted to convert his old oil fired heating system to run on a green alternative such as hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO). He was among the many people who got in touch with the BBC via Your Voice, Your Vote to highlight the issue of affordable and sustainable fuel ahead of next week's general election.

"Your Voice, Your Vote: VAT on private school fees","""It will affect my friends... we do talk about it quite a lot, and where we might go"" said Immi, 15. Now in Year 10, she has attended independent school RGS Worcester since Year 7, and praised the school's teachers and drama offer. ""Obviously I'm very privileged to go to private school but it's going to become a place for the richest of the rich"". Immi said she would like to enter the school's sixth form, but expects she will have to leave if VAT charges are introduced. Immi's mum Jo believes the policy is unfair. ""I've worked for the NHS for 36 years. I've worked evenings, weekend, bank holiday, I've gone without, I drive a 13 year old car, I've not paid off my mortgage"" she said. ""But that's my choice... and this policy removes my choice to do that because it will be unsustainable to keep my daughter there"". From September, RGS Worcester's fees will be more than £6,000 a term, though some students get reductions from scholarships. Under current legislation the price of sending a child to a fee-paying school does not include VAT, at a rate of 20%. If Labour forms the next government they plan to change that and use the additional tax revenue to train more teachers, citing an estimated shortage of 6,000. At a hustings event at King's Worcester this week, parliamentary candidates were questioned by several parents on their positions on the policy. Conservative candidate Marc Bayliss said his party would not introduce VAT on school fees, describing the policy as ""the politics of envy"". He argued the policy was also bad for the state school sector and would prompt an influx of pupils to local schools. Green candidate and music teacher Tor Pingree said her party would introduce VAT charging, but said improvements were sorely needed in state schools. She added her party would not add VAT for special educational needs placements. Liberal Democrat candidate Mel Alcott said she had sent her children to private school. She described the VAT policy as a ""mean and spiteful tax"" which risked separating schoolfriends, and highlighted a shortage of secondary school places in the city. Labour candidate Tom Collins - who pulled out of attending the hustings - told the BBC state schools were in a state of ""absolute crisis"". He said the economic picture required ""tough choices"" to fund improvements. While he accepted the aspirations of many private school parents, he said a lot of children in Worcester had ""zero choice"" about their education at present. Trade Union and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) candidate Mark Davies, Reform UK candidate Andy Peplow and SDP candidate Duncan Murray did also not attend the hustings. Reform UK has said it would give private schools tax relief of 20% and put no VAT on fees, to ""incentivise"" parents to choose independent schools. Duncan Murray from the SDP said his party believed in freedom of choice and did not support a counterproductive and ill thought out policy . TUSC's manifesto calls for good, free education for all, under local authority control. In recent years, Worcester has faced a shortfall of secondary school places, with existing schools taking additional pupils. This is likely to continue to be required up to 2028, according to Worcestershire County Council, when a new four-form school is expected to open.

I dont remember any of it  Yates on nasty crash,nan nan nan
I loved my double wedding - you should try it,"Mrs Green met her husband in Bressingham, Norfolk, shortly before he went to fight in World War Two. William proposed to her in writing, sending her a letter from north Africa where he was stationed, alongside the money to buy herself an engagement ring. Mrs Green was working in a clothing factory making uniforms for the armed forces when William returned. At the time her sister was also planning a wedding. She recalled: ""We both said, 'why not get married on the same day?'"" She said they had always done things together and were so close that ""we even slept in the same bed"" growing up. She added the wedding took place at the village church in July 1949 and it was very traditional.

Joan Green, 97, married her husband William in 1949 and, in the same ceremony,  her younger sister Monica married her husband. Mrs Green said that anyone getting ready to exchange vows should consider a double wedding like she had. She said that couples could not only split the cost of the day, but support each other - even if a joint ceremony is now ""exceptionally rare"". Mrs Green said her and Monica had ""always done things together"", so sharing their wedding day ""made her so happy"". Mrs Green met her husband in Bressingham, Norfolk, shortly before he went to fight in World War Two. William proposed to her in writing, sending her a letter from north Africa where he was stationed, alongside the money to buy herself an engagement ring. Mrs Green was working in a clothing factory making uniforms for the armed forces when William returned. At the time her sister was also planning a wedding. She recalled: ""We both said, 'why not get married on the same day?'"" She said they had always done things together and were so close that ""we even slept in the same bed"" growing up. She added the wedding took place at the village church in July 1949 and it was very traditional. Their bridesmaids were dressed in two different colours, and they had two cakes and two separate best men - but only one meal was served.

We want to hear the truth from politicians,"The Cheshire market town of Macclesfield has been a Conservative stronghold for many years, with the town being held by the party since 1918. But ahead of the general election on 4 July what are people worried about in this area - and could local issues impact the national result? Friends David, Shirley, Jennifer and Graham are chatting over a cup of coffee. They regularly meet up in a coffee shop in Macclesfield and jokingly refer to themselves as  the coffee club. But they say they have concerns about their town. Potholes, says David when asked what he thinks the issues are that matter to local people. Parking, adds Graham. Nobodys really dealing with social care, says Shirley. And they all have concerns about their towns high street. There are no shops so we come out for coffee, adds Shirley, laughing. The friends all say they have not had visits from their local candidates. Shirley says: Wed really like to meet them. To know who they are, Jennifer adds. And honesty seems to be valued highly by the group. [Politicians] are making all these wonderful, wild promises which they cannot fulfil, we know they cant fulfil, says David. They think the public are going to listen and nod and vote for you because youve said this and what happens, nothing, and its very sad. And I think its going to get worse. We want to hear the truth, Graham adds. The constituency of Macclesfield includes the town as well as surrounding towns and villages like Bollington, Poynton and Prestbury along with a large rural area and the Jodrell Bank Observatory, which houses the Lovell Telescope. The area has been Conservative for a long time - since 1918. In the 2019 general election, the seats last Conservative MP had a majority of more than 10,000, receiving more than 52% of the vote. But with some opinion polls suggesting that the Conservatives could lose votes in areas like this, could there be change here? Big names have made visits here in recent weeks. For the Conservatives, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and former PM Lord Cameron have both visited the area. While for Labour, deputy leader Angela Rayner and Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry have also spent time here. With big names paying visits, it seems the town is looking like a key battleground on 4 July.

âHuman shielding in actionâ: Israeli forces strap Palestinian man to jeep,"Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank have tied a wounded Palestinian man to the hood of a military vehicle during a raid on the city of Jenin, appearing to use him as a human shield. A video posted online on Saturday, and verified by Al Jazeera, showed Mujahed Azmi, a Palestinian resident of Jenin, strapped to a military jeep that passes by two ambulances. The family of Azmi told the Reuters news agency that Israeli forces carried out an arrest raid in Jenin, during which he was wounded. When the family asked for an ambulance, the military took Azmi, strapped him onto the hood of their jeep and drove off. Abdulraouf Mustafa, a Palestinian ambulance driver, said the Israeli soldiers refused to hand over Azmi to them. âThe jeep passed by and the wounded man was on the hood,â Mustafa told Al Jazeera. âOne arm was tied to the windshield and the arm was on his abdomen. They drove past us. They refused to give us the patient.â The Israeli military in a statement said Israeli forces were fired at and exchanged fire, wounding a suspect and apprehending him. Soldiers then violated military protocol, the statement said. âThe suspect was taken by the forces while tied on top of a vehicle,â it said. The military said the âconduct of the forces in the video of the incident does not conform to the valuesâ of the Israeli military and that the incident will be investigated and dealt with. Israeli soldiers later released Azmi, allowing paramedics to transport him to hospital where he was taken to the operating room, according to the health workers. The incident came as violence in the occupied West Bank, which was already on the rise before Israelâs war on Gaza, continues to escalate. These include frequent Israeli military raids in West Bank cities and villages, rampages by Jewish settlers in Palestinian villages, as well as attacks by Palestinians. The apparent human shield incident spurred widespread outrage. Francesca Albanese, the United Nationsâ special rapporteur to the occupied Palestinian territory, called it âhuman shielding in actionâ. âIt is flabbergasting how a state born 76 years ago has managed to turn international law literally on its head,â she wrote in a post on X. âThis risks being the end of multilateralism, which for some influential member states no longer serves any relevant purpose.â nan The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), the United Statesâ largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy organisation, also condemned the incident, along with Israelâs killing of some 43 people in attacks on the Shati refugee camp and the Tuffah neighbourhood in northern Gaza. âThese Israeli-US massacres and war crimes must be stopped. American taxpayer dollars should not be used to kill, maim and starve innocent civilians,â said Ibrahim Hooper, CAIRâs national communications director. âThe Biden administration must end its complicity in this genocide and begin to recognise the humanity of the Palestinian people.â David Des Roches, a professor at the National Defense University in the US, meanwhile said if the Israeli military fails to discipline the soldiers involved in the incident, then others could see their actions as a licence to do the same thing. âItâs not standard practice. I hope that the investigation will find out who did this, and I hope there will be exemplary punishment doled out. Otherwise, you can make the fair case that this is evolving into policy,â Des Roches told Al Jazeera. âThe reaction of the Israeli military to this is going to be very telling, and, again, if the soldiers who did this are not disciplined appropriately, you can make the argument that this will be viewed as a licence for other people to do this,â he added. âBut at the end of the day, itâs hard to see that thereâs any tactical advantage to this, and Israel has suffered grave strategic damage from it.â The incident was not theÂ first time the Israeli military has been forced to address troop misconduct. In May of last year, Palestinian rights groups accused Israeli troops of using five children as human shields, including during a raid near Jericho in the occupied West Bank. That same month, the Israeli military opened an investigation after a video emerged of a soldier burning what appeared to be a Quran. The bombing of the Red Crescent headquarters in southern Gaza in January this year is also under investigation. Five people were killed in the attack on the site sheltering some 1,400 people. Also in January, Israeli soldiers in Gaza blew up the main building of a university at the start of the year, after using it as a military base for several weeks. The military said its troops did not get permission to destroy the building. The following month, Israelâs top military lawyer warned troops about violations, saying the soldiersâ actions would ultimately cause strategic damage to the nation."
